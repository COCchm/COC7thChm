Yet surely the similarity is fortuitous. Lovecraft was still at work on the sonnet cycle when Kuttner alerted him to expect the manuscript of “The Secret of Kralitz.” (Could HPL have been influenced by young Kuttner in this instance?) Lovecraft judged Kuttner’s tale a success:</p><p>这个关于死后生活的诡异故事，在大体概念上与洛夫克拉夫特自己《来自犹格斯的真菌》中的十四行诗，第十六、十七、十八首《窗户》、《一段记忆》以及《阴之花园》，惊人的相似。在这本书中，叙述者也洞察了他祖先庄园的秘密，进入了意想不到的死后世界，那里居住着已死的祖先。然而，这种相似肯定是偶然的。当库特纳提醒他期待《克拉利茨的秘密》的稿件时，洛夫克拉夫特还在写十四行诗。(在这种情况下，爱手艺是否受到了年轻库特纳的影响?)洛夫克拉夫特认为库特纳的故事很成功:</p><p>“In spite of the suggestion of youthful overcolouring in spots I like it immensely. It had the Gothic atmosphere touch that I supremely relish—the one intangible element that makes a weird story really potent & fascinating in my eyes. It is a pity that most ‘weird' tales lose this fundamental quality in an effort to be modern and sprightly.” (October 15, 1936)</p><p>“尽管我觉得有些地方显得有点年轻，但我还是非常喜欢它在一些地方的着重润色。我特别享受那种哥特式的氛围——一个难以理解的环境，使一个怪奇故事在我眼中真正地有说服力且迷人。遗憾的是，大多数‘怪奇’故事在追求现代与活泼的过程中失去了这一基本品质。”(1936年10月15日)</p><p>One wonders what Lovecraft would have thought of the increasingly modem tone of the stories Kuttner published in Strange Stories and Weird Tales after HPL’s death. He may have had some tall explaining to do on that day in 1958 when he passed into the gloomy Valhalla of horror authors to meet HPL.</p><p>人们不禁要问，在爱手艺死后，库特纳在《怪奇故事》和《诡丽幻谭》中发表的故事越来越现代，洛夫克拉夫特会怎么想呢？1985年的那一天，当他步入恐怖作家的幽暗瓦尔哈拉殿堂①，去拜会爱手艺之时，他可能会做一些高深的解释。</p><p>[①：瓦尔哈拉殿堂，Valhalla北欧神话中死亡之神奥丁款待阵亡将士英灵的殿堂]</p><p>First publication: Weird Tales, October 1936</p><p>首次出版：《诡丽幻谭》，1936年10月</p><p>***</p><p>I awoke from profound sleep to find two black-swathed forms standing silently beside me, their face  pale blurs in the gloom. As I blinked to clear my sleep-dimmed eyes, one of them beckoned impatiently, and suddenly I realized the purpose of this midnight summons. For years I had been expecting it, ever since my father, the Baron Kralitz, had revealed to me the secret and the curse that hung over our ancient house. And so, without a word, I rose and followed my guides as they led me along the gloomy corridors of the castle that had been my home since birth.</p><p>我从沉眠中醒来，发现两个黑衣人静静地站在我身边，他们的脸在黑暗中变得模糊。当我眨着眼睛来清醒惺忪的睡眼，他们中的一个不耐烦地示意着，我便突然意识到了他们午夜召唤的目的。自从我的父亲克拉利茨男爵向我揭示了笼罩在我们古老的房子上的秘密和诅咒之后，多年以来我便一直都在期待它。如此，我一言不发，起身跟在向导的后面，他们领着我走过这城堡阴暗的走廊，这座城堡从我出生起就是我的家。</p><p>As I proceeded there rose up in my mind the stern face of my father, and in my ears rang his solemn words as he told me of the legendary curse of the House of Kralitz, the unknown secret that was imparted to the eldest son of each generation — at a certain time.</p><p>当我走到那里，我父亲庄重的面容在脑海中浮现，其严肃的措词在我耳边回响，是关乎克拉利茨家族传说中的诅咒，这个不为人知的秘密会传给了每一代的长子——在有把握的时期。</p><p>“When?” I had asked my father as he lay on his death-bed, fighting back the approach of dissolution.</p><p>“是在何时?”在我父亲在弥留之际，我曾问过他这个问题。</p><p>“When you are able to understand,” he had told me, watching my face intently from beneath his tufted white brows. “Some are told the secret sooner than others. Since the first Baron Kralitz the secret has been handed down—”</p><p>“当你能够理解之时。”他从他那簇白眉毛下聚精会神地看着我的脸，告诉我说，“有些人比其他人更早知道这个秘密。自从第一位克拉利茨男爵起，这个秘密便流传下来了。”</p><p>He clutched at his breast and paused. It was fully five minutes before he had gathered his strength to speak again in his rolling, powerful voice. No gasping, death-bed confessions for the Baron Kralitz!</p><p>他抓住自己的胸口，停了下来。足足过了五分钟，他才鼓足勇气，用他那圆润有力的声音说话。克拉利茨男爵的临终自白时没有喘息！</p><p>He said at last, “You have seen the ruins of the old monastery near the village, Franz. The first Baron burnt it and put the monks to the sword. The Abbot interfered too often with the Baron’s whims. A girl sought shelter and the Abbot refused to give her up at the Baron’s demand. His patience was at an end — you know the tales they still tell about him.</p><p>最后他说：“你已经看到过村子附近那座老修道院的废墟了，弗朗茨。一代男爵把它烧了，并用剑杀死了修道士们。院长过于频繁地干涉男爵的突发奇想。一个女孩寻求庇护，院长拒绝了男爵放弃她的要求。他已经忍无可忍了——你知道人们现在还在讲他的故事。”</p><p>“He slew the Abbot, burned the monastery, and took the girl. Before he died the Abbot cursed his slayer, and cursed his sons for unborn generations. And it is the nature of this curse that is the secret of our house.”</p><p>“他杀害了院长，烧了修道院，并且带走了女孩。在他临死之际，院长诅咒了他的凶手，诅咒了他未出生的后代。这个诅咒的本质便是我们家族的秘密。”</p><p>“I may not tell you what the curse is. Do not seek to discover it before it is revealed to you. Wait patiently, and in due time you will be taken by the warders of the secret down the stairway to the underground cavern. And then you will learn the secret of Kralitz.”</p><p>“我可能不会告诉你咒语是什么。在它向你揭示之前，不要试图去发现它。耐心地等待，在时候的时候，你将被秘密的看守带下楼梯到地下洞穴。然后你就会知道克拉利茨的秘密。”</p><p>As the last word passed my father’s lips he died, his stern face still set in its harsh lines.</p><p>当最后一句话从父亲嘴里说出口时，他已经死了，他那严肃的脸上仍然挂着扎眼的皱纹。</p><p>***</p><p>Deep in my memories, I had not noticed our path, but now the dark forms of my guides paused beside a gap in the stone flagging, where a stairway which I had never seen during my wanderings about the castle led into subterranean depths. Down this stairway I was conducted, and presently I came to realize that there was light of a sort — a dim, phosphorescent radiance that came from no recognizable source, and seemed to be less actual light than the accustoming of my eyes to the near-darkness.</p><p>由于我沉浸在回忆之中，因此并没有注意我们走着的路，但现在，我向导们的黑影停在石板路上的一个缺口旁边，在那里，一个我在城堡中四下闲逛时从未见过的，通往地下深处的楼梯。我被带领着走下楼梯，不一会儿，我开始意识到有一种光——一种黯淡的，磷光性的，来源不明的光芒。似乎要比我眼睛逐渐适应黑暗所能感受到的亮度略有些不真实。</p><p>I went down for a long time. The stairway turned and twisted in the rock, and the bobbing forms ahead were my only relief from the monotony of the interminable descent. And at last, deep underground, the long stairway ended, and I gazed over the shoulders of my guides at the great door that barred my path. It was roughly chiseled from the solid stone, and upon it were curious and strangely disquieting carvings, symbols which I did not recognize. It swung open, and I passed through and paused, staring about me through a gray sea of mist.</p><p>我往下走很长时间。楼梯在岩石中迂回曲折，前面晃动的身形是我从单调的，毫无止尽的下降中唯一的解脱。最终，于地下深处，冗长的楼梯抵达尽头，我越过向导的肩膀，注视着挡住我去路的那扇大门。它用坚硬的石头粗略地凿刻而成，上面有一些奇怪而令人不安的雕刻，是一些我不认识的符号。门打开了，我穿过大门，停了下来，透过灰色的雾海凝望着周围。</p><p>I stood upon a gentle slope that fell away into the fog-hidden distance, from which came a pandemonium of muffled bellowing and high-pitched, shrill squeakings vaguely akin to obscene laughter. Dark, half-glimpsed shapes swam into sight through the haze and disappeared again, and great vague shadows swept overhead on silent wings. Almost beside me was a long rectangular table of stone, and at this table two score of men were seated, watching me from eyes that gleamed dully out of deep sockets. My two guides silently took their places among them.</p><p>我站在一个缓坡上，斜坡渐渐消失在雾气笼罩的远处，从那里传来一些低沉吼声与尖锐叫声的混杂，那叫声隐约有点像猥亵的笑。有黑暗，隐约可见的身影在雾中游离浮现，转而再度消失，巨大模糊的影子们扑棱着无声之翼，掠过头顶。一张矩形的长石桌在我的边上，桌旁坐着二十来个人，他们的眼睛从眼窝深处呆呆地望着我。我那两个向导安静地加入他们中间。</p><p>And suddenly the thick fog began to lift. It was swept raggedly away on the breath of a chill wind. The far dim reaches of the cavern were revealed as the mist swiftly dissipated, and I stood silent in the grip of a mighty fear, and, strangely, an equally potent, unaccountable thrill of delight. A part of my mind seemed to ask, “What horror is this?” And another part whispered, “You know this place!”</p><p>突然，浓雾开始消散。它被一阵寒冷的风胡乱地吹走。当其迅速消散，洞中那遥远而模糊的部分显露而出，我被恐惧攫住，静默地站住，但奇怪的是，还有一种同样有力且无法解释的兴奋。我的一部分思绪似乎在问，“这是何种恐怖?”另一部分却在呢语，“你知晓此地！”</p><p>But I could never have seen it before. If I had realized what lay far beneath the castle I could never have slept at night for the fear that would have obsessed me. For, standing silent with conflicting tides of horror and ecstasy racing through me, I saw the weird inhabitants of the underground world.</p><p>但我以前从未看见过它。如果我知道什么在城堡下面很远的地方，我就不会在晚上睡觉了，恐惧会使我心神不宁。我见了地底世界那怪异居民，使得恐惧与狂喜在我体内奔涌，因而静默地站住。</p><p>Demons, monsters, unnamable things! Nightmare colossi strode bellowing through the murk, and amorphous gray things like giant slugs walked upright on stumpy legs. Creatures of shapeless soft pulp, beings with flame-shot eyes scattered over their misshapen bodies like fabled Argus, writhed and twisted there in the evil glow. Winged things that were not bats swooped and fluttered in the tenebrous air, whispering sibilantly — whispering in human voices.</p><p>恶魔，怪物，无以名状之物！噩梦般的巨人咆哮着大步穿过黑暗，无定形的灰色怪形如巨型蛞蝓一般用粗短的腿直立行走。由不成形的柔软肉浆组成的生物，在邪恶的微光中翻滚蠕动着，牠们那畸形的身上分布着能射出火焰的眼目，就如传说中的阿尔戈斯②一般。有翼却非蝙蝠的存在，在阴暗的空气中扑飞鼓振着，咝咝低语着——用人类的声音低语。</p><p>[②：阿尔戈斯Argus，百眼巨人，古希腊神话中的一个巨兽，又成Panoptes]</p><p>Far away at the bottom of the slope I could see the chill gleam of water, a hidden, sunless sea. Shapes mercifully almost hidden by distance and the semi-darkness sported and cried, troubling the surface of the lake, the size of which I could only conjecture. And a flapping thing whose leathery wings stretched like a tent above my head swooped and hovered for a moment, staring with flaming eyes, and then darted off and was lost in the gloom.</p><p>我可以看到，于远处斜坡底部，隐约闪烁着水之寒光，一个隐蔽又阴暗的汪洋。一些影子仁慈地几乎因距离所隐逸，半明半暗的它们骚动叫喊，搅动着湖面，其大小我只能估摸。一个扑动着皮质翅膀，在我头上展开，像个帐篷在空中盘旋了会儿，它用火红的眼睛凝视着我，随后疾驰而去，消失在黑暗中。</p><p>And all the while, as I shuddered with fear and loathing, within me was this evil glee — this voice which whispered, “You know this place! You belong here! Is it not good to be home?”</p><p>一直以来，当我在恐惧和厌恶中颤抖之时，内心却充满了邪恶的欢欣——这声音在呢喃低语：“你知晓此地！你属于这里！回到家里难道不好吗?”</p><p>I glanced behind me. The great door had swung silently shut, and escape was impossible. And then pride came to my aid. I was a Kralitz. And a Kralitz would not acknowledge fear in the face of the devil himself!</p><p>我回头一撇，大门已无声地关闭，脱逃早已成了不可能。而后，自尊来援助我。我是克拉利茨氏，一位克拉里茨在恶魔面前是不会承认恐惧的!</p><p>***</p><p>I stepped forward and confronted the warders, who were still seated regarding me intently from eyes in which a smoldering fire seemed to burn. Fighting down an insane dread that I might find before me an array of fleshless skeletons, I stepped to the head of the table, where there was a sort of crude throne, and peered closely at the silent figure on my right.</p><p>我快步走到守卫面前，他们仍然坐在那里，目不转睛地看着我，眼里似乎有一团郁积的火焰在燃烧。我正击退极愚蠢的担忧，我可能会发现在我面前是一排没有肉的骨架，我走到桌子前面，那里有一个简陋的王座，我仔细地注视着我右边那个无声的影子。</p><p>It was no bare skull at which I gazed, but a bearded, deadly-pale face. The curved, voluptuous lips were crimson, looking almost rouged, and the dull eyes stared through me bleakly. Inhuman agony had etched itself in deep lines on the white face, and gnawing anguish smoldered in the sunken eyes. I cannot hope to convey the utter strangeness, the atmosphere of unearthliness that surrounded him, almost as palpable as the fetid tomb-stench that welled from his dark garments. He waved a black-swathed arm to the vacant seat at the head of the table, and I sat down.</p><p>我所注视的并非光秃的头，而是一张长满胡须、死一般苍白的脸。那弯曲，丰满的嘴唇是绯红的，看上去几乎是抹满了口红，那双呆滞的眼睛阴郁地凝视着我。非人的痛苦在那张苍白的脸上刻下了深深的皱纹，凹陷的眼中郁积着痛苦。我不指望能表达出他周身的那种完全陌生的怪异气氛，几乎和从他深色衣服里散发出来的恶臭一样明显。他挥了挥一只裹着黑布的胳膊，指向桌子首位的空座，我坐了下来。</p><p>This nightmare sense of unreality! I seemed to be in a dream, with a hidden part of my mind slowly waking from sleep into evil life to take command of my faculties. The table was set with old-fashioned goblets and trenchers such as had not been used for hundreds of years. There was meat on the trenchers, and red liquor in the jeweled goblets. A heady, overpowering fragrance swam up into my nostrils, mixed with the grave-smell of my companions and the musty odor of a dank and sunless place.</p><p>这种噩梦般的不真实感！我仿佛身处一梦，我意识中隐藏的一部分正慢慢地从睡梦中醒来，进入邪恶的生活，掌控我的能力。餐桌上摆着几百年来从未用过的老式高脚杯和盘子。盘子里呈着肉，镶着宝石的高脚杯里灌着红色的酒。一股醉人的，浓烈的香味扑鼻而来，混合着我同伴们的尸臭和潮湿无日光之地的霉味。</p><p>Every white face was turned to me, faces that seemed oddly familiar, although I did not know why. Each face was alike in its blood-red, sensual lips and its expression of gnawing agony, and burning black eyes like the abysmal pits of Tartarus stared at me until I felt the short hairs stir on my neck. But — I was a Kralitz! I stood up and said boldly in archaic German that somehow came familiarly from my lips, “I am Franz, twenty-first Baron Kralitz. What do you want with me?”</p><p>每一张苍白的脸都转向我，这些脸都似乎熟悉得出奇，尽管我不知道为什么。每一张面孔在血红，丰腴的嘴唇上，在痛苦的表情上，在那燃烧的，就像塔尔塔洛斯③的深坑一样的黑眼睛，都是一样的。他们凝视着我，直到我感到我脖子上的短毛在颤动。但——我是克拉利茨！我起身，用古德语大胆地说，不知怎么地，这声音从我的唇中传出：“我是弗朗茨，第二十一位克拉利茨男爵！你们找我做什么?”</p><p>[③：塔尔塔洛斯Tartarus，是希腊神话中“地狱”的代名词。]</p><p>A murmur of approval went around the long table. There was a stir. From the foot of the board a huge bearded man arose, a man with a frightful scar that made the left side of his face a horror of healed white tissue. Again the odd thrill of familiarity ran through me; I had seen that face before, and vaguely I remembered looking at it through dim twilight.</p><p>长桌周围响起一阵赞许的低语。这引起了一阵骚动。一个在桌尾的大胡子男人站了起来，他脸上有一块可怕的伤疤，使他的左脸变成了一块骇人，已愈合了的白色组织。我又感到一种奇怪的熟悉感；我以前见过那张脸，我依稀记得是在朦胧暮色中看着它的。</p><p>The man spoke in the old guttural German. “We greet you, Franz, Baron Kralitz. We greet you and pledge you, Franz — and we pledge the House of Kralitz!”</p><p>那男人用古德语说：</p><p>“我们欢迎你，弗朗茨·克拉利茨男爵。我们向你致敬，向你致敬，弗朗茨——我们向克拉利茨家族致意!”</p><p>With that he caught up the goblet before him and held it high. All along the long table the black-swathed ones arose, and each held high his jeweled cup, and pledged me. They drank deeply, savoring the liquor, and I made the bow custom demanded. I said, in words that sprang almost unbidden from my mouth:</p><p>说着，他将面前的高脚杯高高举起。长桌两边都站了起来，每个人都高举着镶满宝石的酒杯，向我致意。他们痛痛快快地喝了一大口，我依照风俗，向他们鞠躬。我几乎是脱口而出地说：</p><p>“I greet you, who are the warders of the secret of Kralitz, and I pledge you in return.”</p><p>“我向您问候，您是克拉里茨秘密的守卫，我也向您致意。”</p><p>All about me, to the farthermost reaches of the dim cavern, a hush fell, and the bellows and howling, and the insane tittering of the flying things, were no longer heard. My companions leaned expectantly toward me. Standing alone at the head of the board, I raised my goblet and drank. The liquor was heady, exhilarating, with a faintly brackish flavor.</p><p>在我周围，在昏暗的洞窟的最深处，一片寂静，再也听不到吼声和嚎声，以及飞行之物发出的疯狂笑声。我的同伴们期待地向我靠过来。我一独自站在桌首，举起酒杯喝了下去。酒带有淡淡的咸味，令人陶醉而振奋。</p><p>And abruptly I knew why the pain-racked, ruined face of my companion had seemed familiar; I had seen it often among the portraits of my ancestors, the frowning, disfigured visage of the founder of the House of Kralitz that glared down from the gloom of the great hall. In that fierce white light of revelation I knew my companions for what they were; I recognized them, one by one, remembering their canvas counterparts. But there was a change! Like an impalpable veil, the stamp of ineradicable evil lay on the tortured faces of my hosts, strangely altering their features, so that I could not always be sure I recognized them. One pale, sardonic face reminded me of my father, but I could not be sure, so monstrously altered was its expression.</p><p>我突然明白了为什么我的同伴那张痛苦憔悴的面容看上去那么熟悉；我经常在我祖先的画像中看到它，克拉利茨家族建立者那愁眉苦脸，面目全非的面孔在昏暗大厅里瞪着眼睛。在揭示那猛烈的白光中，我知晓我同伴是什么人；我对应画中人，一个接一个地认出他们。但是有一个变化！在我主人们那痛苦的脸上，有一种不可磨灭的邪恶烙印，就像一块难以触及的面纱，奇怪地改变着他们的容貌，所以我总不能肯定地认出他们来。一张苍白的，冷笑的脸使我想起了我的父亲，但我不敢肯定，因为他的表情已发生了可怕的变化。</p><p>I was dining with my ancestors — the House of Kralitz!</p><p>我同我的祖先一起进餐——克拉利茨的家族！</p><p>My cup was still held high, and I drained it, for somehow the grim revelation was not entirely unexpected. A strange glow thrilled through my veins, and I laughed aloud for the evil delight that was in me. The others laughed too, a deep-throated merriment like the barking of wolves — tortured laughter from men stretched on the rack, mad laughter in hell! And all through the hazy cavern came the clamor of the devil’s brood! Great figures that towered many spans high rocked with thundering glee, and the flying things tittered slyly overhead. And out over the vast expanse swept the wave of frightful mirth, until the half-seen things in the black waters sent out bellows that tore at my eardrums, and the unseen roof far overhead sent back roaring echoes of the clamor.</p><p>我依然高高举杯，然后一饮而尽，因为，这个可怕的揭示并不完全出乎意料。一种奇怪的光在我的血管里颤动着，我大声地笑着，因为我心中有一种邪恶的喜悦。其他的人也笑了起来，那是一种深沉的欢庆，就像狼群的吠叫——绞刑架的人发出的痛苦笑声，地狱里的疯狂笑声！从朦胧的洞室中传来了魔窟的喧闹。高耸的巨大身影在雷鸣般的欢呼声中摇晃着，飞行之物在头顶偷偷窃笑。可怕的欢乐之浪在这广阔的范围内翻腾着，直至黑水中隐约可见的东西发出的吼声撕扯着我的鼓膜，而在远远高过头顶上，看不见的屋顶又咆哮出喧闹的回声。</p><p>And I laughed with them, laughed insanely, until I dropped exhausted into my seat and watched the scarred man at the other end of the table as he spoke.</p><p>随后我与他们一同发笑，疯狂地笑着，直至我筋疲力尽地坐到座位上，看着桌子另一端那个伤痕累累的男人说话。</p><p>“You are worthy to be of our company, and worthy to eat at the same board. We have pledged each other, and you are one of us; we shall eat together.”</p><p>“你配得上和我们为伍，配得上同我们吃饭。我们彼此致意，你就在我们中间。我们一起吃吧。”</p><p>And we fell to, tearing like hungry beasts at the succulent white meat in the jeweled trenchers. Strange monsters served us, and at a chill touch on my arm I turned to find a dreadful crimson thing, like a skinned child, refilling my goblet. Strange, strange and utterly blasphemous was our feast. We shouted and laughed and fed there in the hazy light, while all around us thundered the evil horde. There was hell beneath Castle Kralitz, and it held high carnival this night.</p><p>我们像饥饿的野兽一样撕咬着镶满宝石的盘子里多汁的白肉。奇怪的怪物为我们服务，我的胳膊上有一股寒意，我转过身来，看到一个可怕的深红色的东西，像是个被剥了皮的孩子，正在给我斟满酒杯。怪异，怪异，我们的盛宴是全然的亵渎。我们在朦胧的灯光下喊叫着，大笑着，进食着，而我们周围则群邪恶的家伙在怒吼。克拉利茨城堡下面是地狱，今晚它举行了场盛大的狂欢。</p><p>***</p><p>Presently we sang a fierce drinking-song, swinging the deep cups back and forth in rhythm with our shouted chant. It was an archaic song, but the obsolete words were no handicap, for I mouthed them as though they had been learned at my mother’s knee. And at the thought of my mother a trembling and a weakness ran through me abruptly, but I banished it with a draft of the heady liquor.</p><p>过了一会儿，我们唱了一支劲头十足的饮酒歌，随着我们的高声吟唱，让大杯伴随着节奏前后摇晃着。这是一首古老的歌，但那些老式的词句并非阻碍，因我默念着它们，仿佛它们是在我母亲的膝上学会的。一想起我的母亲，我突然一阵虚弱，浑身发抖，但我喝了一大口烈酒，把其赶走了。</p><p>Long, long we shouted and sang and caroused there in the great cavern, and after a time we arose together and trooped to where a narrow, high-arched bridge spanned the tenebrous waters of the lake. But I may not speak of what was at the other end of the bridge, nor of the unnamable things that I saw — and did! I learned of the fungoid, inhuman beings that dwell on far cold Yuggoth, of the cyclopean shapes that attend unsleeping Cthulhu in his submarine city, of the strange pleasures that the followers of leprous, subterranean Yog-Sothoth may possess, and I learned, too, of the unbelievable manner in which Iod, the Source, is worshipped beyond the outer galaxies. I plumbed the blackest pits of hell and came back — laughing. I was one with the rest of those dark warders, and I joined them in the saturnalia of horror until the scarred man spoke to us again.</p><p>我们在大洞窟里又叫喊又歌唱，纵情狂欢了很久很久，过了段时间之后，我们一起站起身来，成群结队地上了一座狭窄高拱，横跨着黑暗湖水的桥。但我却不能说出在桥的另一端发生了什么，也不能说出我所见所行的那些不可名状之事。我得知了真菌，居住在寒冷犹格斯上的非人住民，又得知了巨大的存在于海底城市侍奉着警觉的克苏鲁，还有不洁的，地下犹格·索托斯的追随者可能拥有的奇怪快乐，以及我还得知了伊欧德，源①，令人难以置信地被外星系所崇拜。我探索地狱至黑的坑，然后笑着回来了。我是其余那些黑暗守卫中的一员，随后我加入了他们的恐怖狂欢节，直到那个伤痕的男人再次同我们对话。</p><p>[①：源，the Source，不知道怎么翻比较好]</p><p>“Our time grows short,” he said, his scarred and bearded white face like a gargoyle’s in the half-light. “We must depart soon. But you are a true Kralitz, Franz, and we shall meet again, and feast again, and make merry for longer than you think. One last pledge!”</p><p>“我们的时间不多了，”他说，在半明半暗的光线下，他那张满是伤疤和胡须的苍白的脸就像一只滴水兽。“我们必须马上离开。但你是一位真正的克拉利茨氏，弗朗茨，我们还会再见面的，还会再吃一顿的，寻欢作乐的时间比你想象的要长得多。最后一次致意!”</p><p>I gave it to him. “To the House of Kralitz! May it never fall!”</p><p>我向他致意：“为了克拉利茨家族！愿它永不陨落！”</p><p>And with an exultant shout we drained the pungent dregs of the liquor.</p><p>随着一阵欢呼，我们饮尽了酒中辛辣的渣滓。</p><p>Then a strange lassitude fell upon me. With the others I turned my back on the cavern and the shapes that pranced and bellowed and crawled there, and I went up through the carved stone portal. We filed up the stairs, up and up, endlessly, until at last we emerged through the gaping hole in the stone flags and proceeded, a dark, silent company, back through those interminable corridors. The surroundings began to grow strangely familiar, and suddenly I recognized them.</p><p>这时我感到了一种奇怪的疲倦。我同其他人一起，转身离开了洞窟，里面那些欢跃，咆哮，匍匐的身影，从石雕成的洞门爬了上去，然后穿过石门上了楼。我们排成纵队，不停地向上，向上，直到最后我们从石板的裂缝中钻了出来，继续前进，一个黑暗，沉默的队伍，穿过那些没完没了的走廊。周围的环境开始变得出奇地熟悉起来，我突然认出了他们。</p><p>We were in the great burial vaults below the castle, where the Barons Kralitz were ceremoniously entombed. Each Baron had been placed in his stone casket in his separate chamber, and each chamber lay, like beads on a necklace, adjacent to the next, so that we proceeded from the farthermost tombs of the early Barons Kralitz toward the unoccupied vaults. By immemorial custom, each tomb lay bare, an empty mausoleum, until the time had come for its use, when the great stone coffin, with the memorial inscription carved upon it, would be carried to its place. It was fitting, indeed, for the secret of Kralitz to be hidden here.</p><p>我们正处于城堡下面的大墓室里，克莱里茨男爵们都被隆重地埋葬在那里。每位男爵都被安置在各自房间里的石棺里，每个房间都像项链上的珠子一样，一前一后地排列着，这样，我们就从早期男爵的坟墓中最远处的克拉利茨墓出发，走向空闲的墓穴。按照古老的习俗，每一座坟墓都是光秃秃的，空荡荡的，直到使用它的时刻到来，那具巨大的石棺，上面刻着铭文，将被抬到它的位置。确实，把克拉利茨的秘密藏在这里是很合适的。</p><p>Abruptly I realized that I was alone, save for the bearded man with the disfiguring scar. The others had vanished, and, deep in my thoughts, I had not missed them. My companion stretched out his black-swathed arm and halted my progress, and I turned to him questioningly. He said in his sonorous voice, “I must leave you now. I must go back to my own place.” And he pointed to the way whence we had come.</p><p>我突然意识到我是独自一人，除了那个留着胡子、留着难看伤疤的男人。其他的人都不见了，在我的内心深处，我并不想念他们。我的同伴伸出了他那裹着黑布的胳膊，阻止了我的前进，我疑惑地转向他。他用洪亮的声音说：“我现在必须离开你了，我必须回到我所属之地。”然后他指了指我们来的方向。</p><p>I nodded, for I had already recognized my companions for what they were. I knew that each Baron Kralitz had been laid in his tomb, only to arise as a monstrous thing neither dead nor alive, to descend into the cavern below and take part in the evil saturnalia. I realized, too, that with the approach of dawn they had returned to their stone coffins, to lie in a death-like trance until the setting sun should bring brief liberation. My own occult studies had enabled me to recognize these dreadful manifestations.</p><p>我点点头，因为已认出我的同伴都是些什么。我知道，每个克拉里茨男爵都被埋葬在他的坟墓里，只会以一个不生不死的怪异存在出现，潜入地下的洞穴，参加邪恶的狂欢节。我还意识到，随着黎明的到来，他们又回到了石棺，昏迷不醒地躺在那里，直到夕阳将带来短暂的解脱。我自己的神秘学研究使我能够认出这些可怕的现象。</p><p>I bowed to my companion and would have proceeded on my way to the upper parts of the castle, but he barred my path. He shook his head slowly, his scar hideous in the phosphorescent gloom.</p><p>I said, “May I not go yet?”</p><p>我向我的同伴鞠躬，随后准备去城堡的上半部分，但他挡住了我的去路。他缓缓地摇了摇头，他的伤疤在发出磷光的幽暗中显得很可怕。</p><p>我说：“我还不能走吗？”</p><p>He stared at me with tortured, smoldering eyes that had looked into hell itself, and he pointed to what lay beside me, and in a flash of nightmare realization I knew the secret of the curse of Kralitz. There came to me the knowledge that made my brain a frightful thing in which shapes of darkness would ever swirl and scream; the dreadful comprehension of when each Baron Kralitz was initiated into the brotherhood of blood. I knew — I knew — that no coffin had ever been placed unoccupied in the tombs, and I read upon the stone sarcophagus at my feet the inscription that made my doom known to me — my own name, “Franz, twenty-first Baron Kralitz.”</p><p>他用折磨人的，阴燃着的眼睛凝望着我，那双眼睛曾窥视过地狱本身，他指了指躺在我身边的东西，在一刹那间，我恍然大悟，知道了克拉利茨诅咒的秘密。我突然明白了一件可怕的事情，黑暗的形状在我的脑中盘旋尖叫；对每个克拉利茨男爵何时开始融入血脉的可怕理解。我知道——我知道——坟墓里从来没有空棺，我在脚边的石棺上读到铭文，上面书写着我的命运——我自己的名字，“弗朗茨，第二十一位克拉利茨男爵。”</p></body></html>
