<p><strong><font color=#800000 size=6>The Eater of souls</font></strong></p>
<p>作者：Henry Kuttner</p>
<p>[译者：莫城幽]</p>
<p>Of this brief tale, Lovecraft was more restrained in his praise: “It has some good touches." Ouch. As a writer of Dunsanian pastiches himself Lovecraft might have had a good bit more to say of this one had he liked it—or if he disliked it!</p>
<p>Lin Carter followed both Kuttner and Lovecraft in writing his own Dunsany pastiches, his Simrana tales. One of these, “The Gods of Niom Parma”, is perhaps his best work. At any rate, let it be noted that the formula introduction of all the Simrana tales, “In Simrana they tell the tale of... ”, derives neither from Lovecraft nor from Dunsany, but rather from Kuttner’s two tales of Bel Yarnak.</p>
<p>对于这个简短的故事，洛夫克拉夫特的赞美要克制得多：“它有些不错的地方。”哎哟。洛夫克拉夫特本人作为模仿邓萨尼风的作家，如果他喜欢这个故事，亦或是不喜，都可能会对此作更多的评论。林·卡特继库特纳和洛夫克拉夫特之后，创作了自己的邓萨尼的模仿品，Simrana传说。其中之一，《Niom Parma的众神》或许是他最好的作品。无论如何，请注意所有Simrana传说格式化的介绍，“在Simrana，他们讲述了…的故事",这既不是来自洛夫克拉夫特，也不是来自邓萨尼，而是来自库特纳的两个关于贝尔·亚纳克的故事。</p>

<p>***</p>
<p>They tell it in Bel Yarnak, in a language not of Earth, that a malignant and terrible being once dwelt in that incredible abyss named the Gray Gulf of Yarnak. Not on earth, nor on any planet that spins about any star in the skies we know, is Bel Yarnak; but beyond Betelgeuse, beyond the Giant Stars, on a green and joyous world still in its lusty youth are the towers and silver minarets of this city. Nor are the dwellers in Bel Yarnak anthropoid nor in any way man-like; yet there are fires during the long warm nights in curious hearths, and wherever in this universe there are fires there will be tales told about them, and breathless listeners to bring contentment to the heart of the teller of tales. The Sindara rules benignantly over Bel Yarnak; yet in the old days fear and doom lay like a shroud over the land, and in the Gray Gulf of Yarnak a brooding horror dwelt loathsomely. And a strange enchantment chilled the skies and hid the triple moons behind a darkened pall.</p>
<p>他们用一种非地球的，贝尔·亚纳克(Bel Yarnak)的语言讲述，有一个凶狠可怕的存在曾住在那个叫亚纳克的灰色深渊(the Gray Gulf of Yarnak)里。贝尔·亚纳克不在地球上，也不在我们所知的任何围绕天空中任何恒星旋转的行星上；但是，在参宿四之外，在巨星之外，在这个绿色而欢乐的世界，这座城市的塔楼与银色尖塔仍在青春的活力之中。贝尔·亚纳克的居民不是类人的，也一点都不像人类；然而，在漫长而温暖的夜晚，在奇异的壁炉里会有火焰，在这个宇宙中，哪里有火焰，哪里就会有关于它们的故事，就会有屏息的听众，让讲故事的人带来内心的满足。辛达拉(The Sindara)仁慈地统治着贝尔·亚纳克；然而，在过去，恐惧和厄运就像一层裹尸布笼罩着大地，徘徊不去的恐怖令人厌恶地居于亚纳克的灰色深渊里。一种奇怪的魔力冰冻了天空，并将三颗卫星隐藏在一层黑暗的帷幕后。</p>
<p>For a being had come to glut its evil hunger in the land, and those who dwelt in Bel Yarnak called it the Eater of Souls. In nowise could this being be described, for none had seen it save under circumstances which precluded the possibility of return. Yet in the gulf it brooded, and when its hunger stirred it would send forth a soundless summons, so that in tavern and temple, by fireside and in the blackness of the night some would rise slowly, with a passionless look of death upon their features, and would depart from Bel Yarnak toward the Gray Gulf. Nor would they ever return. It was said that the thing in the gulf was half a demon and half a god, and that the souls of those whom it slew served it eternally, fulfilling strange missions in the icy wastes between the stars. This being had come from the dark sun, the hydromancers said, where it had been conceived by an unholy alliance between those timeless Ancients who filter strangely between the universes and a Black Shining One of unknown origin, the necromancers said other things, But they hated the hydromancers, who were powerful then, and their rune-casting was generally discredited. Yet the Sindara listened to both schools of mages, and pondered upon his throne of chalcedony, and presently determined to set forth voluntarily to the Great Gulf of Yarnak, which was reputed to be bottomless.</p>
<p>因为某个造物已然来临，要在这片土地上填饱牠邪恶的欲望，那些住在贝尔·亚纳克的人叫它噬魂者。对于这个存在没有任何描述，因为除了在不可能返回的情况下，谁也没有看到过牠。然而，它却在深渊中沉思，当牠的饥饿来袭时，它会发出无声的召唤。在客栈和庙宇中，在炉边，在漆黑的夜里，有些人慢慢地爬起来，脸上带着死一般冷淡的表情，离开贝尔·亚纳克，向灰色深渊走去。他们也永远不会回来。据说深渊中的东西是半魔半神的，那些被牠杀死之人的灵魂会永远侍奉牠，在群星间冰冷的荒地上完成奇怪的使命。这个存在自黑日而来，水魔术师说，它是由那些不受时间所控的，到处在宇宙中进行奇怪渗透的众古神(Ancients)与一位邪恶光辉者(a Black Shining One)的不洁联姻所孕育而出，死灵法师还提到了别的内容，但是他们憎恶比他们强大的水魔术师，而且他们的符文铸件普遍遭到质疑。不过辛达拉听了两派巫师的意见，并在他的玉髓王座上深思熟虑，不久就决定自愿前往那号称无底的亚纳克大深渊。</p>
<p>The necromancers gave the Sindara curious implements made of the bones of the dead, and the hydromancers gave him intricately twisted transparent tubes of crystal, which would be useful in battling the Eater of Souls. Thereafter the necromancers and the hydromancers squatted on their haunches in the city gate and howled dismally as the Sindara rode westward on his gorlak, that fleet but repugnantly shaped reptile. After a time the Sindara discarded both the weapons of the hydromancers and the necromancers, for he was a worshipper of Vorvadoss, as had been each Sindara in his time. None might worship Vorvadoss save the Sindara of Bel Yarnak, for such is the god’s command; and presently the Sindara dismounted from his gorlak and prayed fervently to Vorvadoss. For a time there was no response.</p>
<p>死灵法师给了辛达拉一些用死者骨头做成的奇怪用具，水魔术师给他了些复杂弯曲的透明水晶管，在与噬魂者交战时，那会很有用。之后，当辛达拉骑着他那敏捷但令人反感的爬行动物，格拉克(gorlak)向西而行时，死灵法师和水魔术师们蹲在城门口，凄惨地嚎啕大哭。过了一段时间后，辛达拉丢弃了水魔术师和死灵法师的武器，因为他是沃瓦多斯(Vorvadoss)的崇拜者，就像他那个时代每一位辛达拉一样。除了贝尔·亚纳克的辛达拉，没有人会崇拜沃瓦多斯，因为这是神的命令;不久，辛达拉从他的格拉克上下来，热切地向沃瓦多斯祈祷。有一段时间并没有回应。</p>
<p>Then the sands were troubled, and a whirling and dancing of mist-motes blinded the Sindara. Out of the maelstrom the god spoke thinly, and his voice was like the tinkling of countless tiny crystal goblets.</p>
<p>接着，沙子开始被扰乱，一团旋转飞舞的尘粒迷了辛达拉的眼。在混乱之中，神发出了微小的声音，祂的声音就像无数小水晶酒杯发出的叮当声。</p>
<p>“Thou goest to doom,” Vorvadoss said ominously. “But thy son sleeps in Bel Yarnak, and I shall have a worshipper when thou art vanished. Go therefore fearlessly, since god cannot conquer god, but only man who created him.”</p>
<p>“汝将走向厄运，”沃瓦多斯不详地说。““但汝之子在贝尔·亚纳克沉眠，当汝消失，吾将新获一位崇拜者。无畏地前行吧，因为神不能征服神，只有创造他的那位才能做到。”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Speaking thus cryptically Vorvadoss withdrew, and the Sindara, after pondering, continued his journey. In time he came to that incredible abyss from which men say the nearer moon was born, and at its edge he fell prone and lay sick and shuddering, peering down into mist-shrouded emptiness. For a cold wind blew up from the gulf, and it seemed to have no bottom. Looming far in the distance he could just discern the further brink.</p>
<p>说着，沃瓦多斯隐秘地离去，辛达拉在沉思之后，继续了他的旅程。过了一段时间，他来到了那个难以置信的深渊，据说最靠近的卫星就是自此而生，在其边缘，他虚弱地俯卧在地，浑身发抖，凝望着被雾气遮蔽的虚空。因为从深渊里吹来了一阵冷风，它似乎没有底。他只能辨出远处若隐若现的悬崖。</p>
<p>Clambering up the rough stones came he whom the Sindara had set out to find; he came swiftly, making use of his multiple appendages to lift himself. He was white and hairy and appallingly hideous, but his misshapen head came only to the Sindara’s waist, although in girth his spidery limbs rendered a shocking illusion of hugeness. In his wake came the souls he had taken for his own; they were a plaintive whispering and stirring in the air, swooping and moaning and sighing for lost Nirvana. The Sindara drew his blade and struck at his enemy.</p>
<p>辛达拉去寻找的那个造物爬上了粗糙的石头；牠极速而来，并用其多个附肢撑起自己。牠白色有毛，丑陋得吓人，但牠那畸形的头只长到辛达拉的腰部，尽管牠那蜘蛛般的四肢使其有种巨大的错觉。随其之后，牠带走了牠所拥有的灵魂;他们在空气中哀伤地低语和骚动，俯冲着，呻吟着，为失去的圆寂而叹息。辛达拉拔出他的剑，向其敌人攻去。</p>
<p>Of that battle sagas are still sung, for it raged along the brink for a timeless interval of eternity. In the end the Sindara was hacked and bleeding and spent, and his opponent was untouched and chuckling loathsomely. Then the demon prepared for his meal.</p>
<p>关于那场战斗的事迹至今仍被传颂，因为它沿着崖边奔腾，永不停息。最终，辛达拉被砍伤，血流不止，而他的对手却安然无恙，令人生厌地咯咯笑着。然后恶魔准备牠的食物。</p>
<p>Into the Sindara’s mind came a whisper, the thin calling of Vorvadoss. He said: “There are many kinds of flesh in the universes, and other compounds which are not flesh. Thus doth the Eater of Souls feed.” And he told the Sindara of the incredible manner of that feeding, of the fusing of two beings, of the absorption of the lesser, and of the emergence therefrom of an augmented half-god, while the uncaged soul flew moaning in the train of those who served the being. Into the Sindara’s mind came knowledge and with it a grim resolve. He flung wide his arms and welcomed the ghastly embrace, for Vorvadoss had also spoken of the manner in which the doom might be lifted.</p>
<p>辛达拉的脑中出现了一阵低语，沃瓦多斯微小的呼唤。祂说：“宇宙间有着形形色色的肉体，以及其他非肉体的混合物。噬魂者就这样进食。”祂告诉了辛达拉难以置信的进食方式，两种生命的融合，对弱者的吸收，以及由此而来的半神的扩张，同时被囚禁的灵魂加入牠那些服务者的行列之中。知识进入了辛达拉的头脑，随之而来的是一个严峻的决心。他猛烈地张开膀臂，迎接恐怖的怀抱，因为沃瓦多斯也谈到了解脱厄运的方法。</p>
<p>The thing sprang to meet him, and an intolerable agony ground frightfully within the Sindara’s bone and flesh; the citadel of his being rocked, and his soul cowered shrieking in its chamber. There on the edge of the Gray Gulf of Yarnak a monstrous fusion took place, a metamorphosis and a comingling that was blasphemous and horrible beyond all imagining. As a thing disappears in quicksand, so the being and the Sindara melted into each other’s body.</p>
<p>那东西跳起来迎接他，一种无法忍受的痛苦可怕地盘踞在辛达拉的骨肉之中；他的城塞开始震动，他的灵魂畏缩在牠体内，尖叫着。在亚纳克的灰色深渊的边缘，一场可怕的融合发生了，这是一种变形，是超越一切想象的，亵渎与可怕的降临。就如一样东西消失在流沙中，那造物和辛达拉融进彼此的身躯。</p>
<p>Yet even in that blinding agony a sharper pain came to the Sindara as he saw across the plain the beauty of this land over which he had ruled. He thought he had never seen anything so beautiful as this green and joyous land of his, and a pain was in his heart, a sense of empty loss and an aching void which could not ever be filled. And he looked away to the black evil eyes of the Eater of Souls that were but inches away from his own, and he looked beyond the being to where cold emptiness lay gray and horrible. There were tears in his eyes and a gnawing ache in his heart for the silver minarets and towers of Bel Yarnak, that had lain naked and beautiful beneath the glowing light of the triple moons, for he should never see that place anymore.</p>
<p>然而，即使在这种使人眩目的痛苦中，当辛达拉在平原上看到他所统治的这片土地的美丽时，他感到了一种更为强烈的痛苦。他觉得自己从未见过如此美丽的地方，他的心中有一种痛苦，一种徒劳的失落感，一种永远无法填补的空虚感。他移开目光，转向噬魂者那离他只有几英尺远的邪恶黑眼睛，然后越过了那造物，看见了灰色与恐怖里的寒冷与空寂。他的眼中含着泪，心里对贝尔·亚纳克的银色尖塔与塔楼感到揪心的疼痛，它们在三个卫星的照耀下直率而美丽地矗立着，因为他再也见不到那个地方了。</p>
<p>He turned his head again, and for the last time, blinded with his tears and with his doom upon him. As he leaped forward he heard a despairing shriek, and then half-god and man were spinning dizzily downward, seeing the precipice rushing up past them. For Vorvadoss had said that thus, and only thus, could the spell be lifted.</p>
<p>And the cliff wall curved inward as it swept down, so presently it receded into the dim gray haze, and the Sindara fell in empty mist and into final unstirring darkness.</p>
<p>他再一次转过头来，也是最后一次，被泪水与厄运蒙住眼。他向前跃去，听到一声绝望的尖叫，然后半神半人头晕目眩地向下旋转，看着悬崖从他们身边飞过。因为沃瓦多斯曾说过，只有这样，才能解除魔力。岩壁向下倾斜时向内弯曲，很快就隐没在朦胧的灰色烟雾中，而辛达拉则陷入了空寂的雾中，进入最终平静的黑暗。</p>
