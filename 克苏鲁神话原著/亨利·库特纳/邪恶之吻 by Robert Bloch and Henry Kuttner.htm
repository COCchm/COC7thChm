Bloch recalls that “The Black Kiss was basically his {Kuttner’s} concept", as opposed to their other team efforts which had been “worked out mutually in advance or during the course of our consecutive drafts. “Kuttner, as in the case of all their collaborations, wrote the first draft, which his partner then completely rewrote (Bloch letter to Robert M. Price, January 25, 1994).</p><p>这个故事是亨利·库特纳与罗伯特合写的，它是以神秘学调查员迈克尔·利(Michael Leigh)为主角的流产系列中的第二部。布洛克回忆说，“邪恶之吻基本上是他(库特纳)的设定”，“我们提前或是在连续起草的过程中互相拟定的。”和他们的所有合作一样，库特纳写第一份稿子，然后他的搭档又完全重写一遍。(布洛克1994年1月25日，写给罗伯特.M.普莱斯的信)</p><p>One wonders at the tangential role of Michael Leigh in the story. He remains offstage for most of the story, represented by proxy in the form of an inscrutable Oriental colleague. Perhaps it was to mask the fact that Leigh would have played an almost identical role here as in “The Salem Horror", saying almost precisely the same things in both stories, which after all appeared in rapid succession. Just as Bloch became “Tarleton Fiske” and Kuttner became “Keith Hammond” when either had two stories slated for the same issue of Strange Stories, perhaps Michael Leigh in effect assumed an alias as well!</p><p>人们对迈克尔·利在这个故事中所扮演的无关紧要的角色感到惊奇。在整个故事的大部分时间里，他都处于幕后，以一个神秘的东方同僚的形象出场。也许是为了掩盖这样一个事实，即利在这里扮演的角色几乎与《塞勒姆恐怖》(the Salem Horror)中的角色保持一致，在两个故事中说的话几乎完全一样，毕竟这两个故事是相继出现的。就像当他们都有两个故事被选为同一期的《怪奇故事》(Strange Stories)时，布洛克化身为“塔勒顿·菲斯克”(Tarleton·Fiske)，库特纳变成了“凯斯·哈蒙德”(Keith Hammond)，也许迈克尔·利实际上还用了化名！</p><p>First publication: Weird Tales, June 1937.</p><p>首次出版：《诡丽幻谭》，1937年6月。</p><p>***</p><p>They rise in green robes roaring from the green hells of the sea,</p><p>Where fallen skies and evil hues and eyeless creatures be.</p><p>他们身穿绿袍，咆哮着从海的绿色地狱中上来，</p><p>那有着陨落的天空，邪恶色调还有无眼的生物。</p><p>— Chesterton, “Lepanto”</p><p>——《勒潘托》切斯特顿</p><p>1.

They’re not the usual haphazard nightmares. They seem—I know it sounds ridiculous—they seem planned. ”</p><p>“我从来没有遇到过这样的困扰，”他说。“这些梦是如此奇怪地反复出现。它们不是通常偶然的噩梦。他们似乎——我知道这听起来很荒谬——他们似乎是有规划的。"</p><p>“Dreams planned? Nonsense.” Doctor Hedwig looked scornful. “You, Mr. Dean, are an artist, and naturally of impressionable temperament. This house at San Pedro is new to you, and you say you’ve heard wild tales. The dreams are due to imagination and overwork.”</p><p>“有规划的梦?荒谬。”海德维格一脸轻蔑。“你，迪安先生，是一位艺术家，敏感的气质是自然的。圣佩德罗(San Pedro)的这幢房子对你而言是新的，你说你听过荒诞不经的故事。这些梦应归于幻想和劳累过度。”</p><p>Dean glanced out of the window, a frown on his unnaturally pale face.</p><p>迪安向窗外瞥了一眼，对他那张不自然的苍白的脸皱起了眉头。</p><p>“I hope you’re right,” he said, softly. “But dreams shouldn’t make me look like this. Should they?”</p><p>“我希望你是对的，”他轻声说。“但梦不应该让我变成这样。它们应该吗?”</p><p>A gesture indicated the great blue rings beneath the young artist’s eyes. His hands indicated the bloodless pallor of his gaunt cheeks.</p><p>这位年轻艺术家用手势指着发青的大眼圈，又用双手示意着他那毫无血色，苍白消瘦两颊。</p><p>“Overwork has done that, Mr. Dean. I know what has happened to you better than you do yourself.”</p><p>“是过度工作造成的，迪安先生。我比你自己更清楚发生了什么。”</p><p>The white-haired physician picked up a sheet covered with his own scarcely decipherable notes and scrutinized it in review.</p><p>白发苍苍的医师拿起一张纸，上面写满了他自己难以辨认的说明，仔细检查着。</p><p>“You inherited this house at San Pedro a few months ago, eh? And you moved in alone to do some work.”</p><p>“你几个月前继承了圣佩德罗的这幢房子，嗯?然后你搬进来独自工作。”</p><p>"Yes. The seacoast here has some marvelous scenes.” For a moment Dean’s face looked youthful once more as enthusiasm kindled its ashy fires. Then he continued, with a troubled frown. “But I haven’t been able to paint, lately—not seascapes, anyway, it’s very odd. My sketches don’t seem quite right anymore. There seems to be a quality in them that I don’t put there—”</p><p>“是的。这里的海岸有一些奇迹般的景色。”有那么一会儿，迪安的脸又显得年轻了，因为热情点燃了它那灰白的火焰。然后愁眉不展，继续说下去。“可我最近一直不能够画画——反正不是海景，很奇怪。我的素描看起来不太对了。似乎有一些我没有加进去的一种性质——”</p><p>“A quality, did you say?”</p><p>“一种性质，你是说?”</p><p>“Yes, a quality of malignness, if I can call it that. It’s indefinable. Something behind the picture takes all the beauty out. And I haven’t been overworking these last weeks, Doctor Hedwig.”</p><p>“是的，一种邪恶的性质(a quality of malignness)，如果我可以这么叫它的话。这幅画背后的东西把所有的美都抹消了。并且这几周我没有过度工作，海德维格医生。”</p><p>The doctor glanced again at the paper in his hand.</p><p>医生又瞥了眼他手里的纸。</p><p>“Well, I disagree with you there. You might be unconscious of the effort you expend. These dreams of the sea that seem to worry you are meaningless, save as an indication of your nervous condition.”</p><p>“好吧，我不同意你的看法。你可能没有意识到你付出的努力。这些关于大海的梦，除了表明你紧张的状态外，似乎没有任何意义。”</p><p>“You’re wrong.” Dean rose, suddenly. His voice was shrill.</p><p>“你错了。”迪安突然站了起来，发出尖锐的嗓音。</p><p>“That’s the dreadful part of it. The dreams are not meaningless. They seem cumulative; cumulative and planned. Each night they grow more vivid, and I see more of that green, shining place under the sea. I get closer and closer to those black shadows swimming there, those shadows that I know aren’t shadows but something worse. I see more each night. It’s like a sketch I’d block out, gradually adding more and more until—”</p><p>“那是它可怕之处。这些梦并不是毫无意义的。它们似乎是渐增的，渐增的和有规划的。每个晚上，它们变得越来越生动，我也看到了海底那片绿油油、闪闪发光的地方。我距离在那里游动的黑影越来越近了，我知道的那些阴影不是阴影，而是更糟糕的东西。我每晚都能看到更多。它就像一个草图，我会把它画出来，然后慢慢地添加越来越多，直到——”</p><p>Hedwig watched his patient keenly. He suggested, “Until—”</p><p>海德维格敏锐地注视着他的病人。他暗示：“直到——”</p><p>But Dean’s tense face relaxed. He had caught himself just in time. “No, Doctor Hedwig. You must be right. It’s overwork and nervousness, as you say. If I believed what the Mexicans had told me about Morelia Godolfo—well, I’d be mad and a fool.”</p><p>但迪安拉紧的脸放松了下来。他及时地控制住了自己。“不，海德维格医生。你一定是对的。就像你说的那样，是过度工作与神经过敏。如果我相信墨西哥人告诉我的关于莫雷利娅·戈道尔夫的事——好吧，那我就是疯子和傻子。”</p><p>“Who is this Morelia Godolfo? Some woman who has been filling you with foolish tales?”</p><p>“莫雷利娅·戈道尔夫是谁?是不是有个女人一直在向你灌输愚蠢的故事?”</p><p>Dean smiled. “No need to worry about Morelia. She was my great-great-grand-aunt. She used to live in the San Pedro house and started the legends, I think.”</p><p>迪安笑了：“不用担心莫雷利娅，她是我的老祖宗。她以前住在圣佩德罗房子里，我想是她开始了这个传说。”</p><p>Hedwig had been scribbling on a piece of paper. “Well, I see, young man! You heard these legends; your imagination ran riot; you dreamed. This prescription will fix you up.”</p><p>海德维格一直在纸上草草地写。“哦，我明白了，年轻人你听到了这些传说，你的想象力失控了，你就做梦了。这个处方能治好你的病。”</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>“谢谢。”</p><p>Dean took the paper, lifted his hat from the table, and started for the door. In the doorway he paused, smiling wryly.</p><p>迪安接过纸，他从桌上拿起帽子，朝门口走去。他在门口停了下来，苦笑着。</p><p>“But you’re not quite correct in thinking the legends started me dreaming, Doctor. I began to dream them before I learned the history of the house.”</p><p>“但你认为传说使我开始做梦是不完全正确的，医生。在我了解这所房子的历史之前，我就开始梦见它们了。”</p><p>And with that he went out.</p><p>说完，他就出去了。</p><p>Driving back to San Pedro, Dean tried to understand what had happened to him. But always he came up against a blank wall of impossibility. Any logical explanation wandered off into a tangle of fantasy. The one thing he could not explain—which Doctor Hedwig had not been able to explain—was the dreams.</p><p>开车回到圣佩德罗，迪安试图去理解什么发生在了他身上。但他总能迎上一堵不可能的空虚之墙。任何合乎逻辑的解释都陷入了混乱的幻想之中。有一件事他无法解释——海德维格医生也无法解释——那就是梦。</p><p>The dreams started soon after he came into his legacy: this ancient house north of San Pedro, which had so long stood deserted. The place was picturesquely old, and that attracted Dean from the first. It had been built by one of his ancestors when the Spaniards still ruled California. One of the Deans—the name was Dena, then—had gone to Spain and returned with a bride. Her name was Morelia Godolfo, and it was this long-vanished woman about whom all the subsequent legends centered.</p><p>梦在他继承遗产后不久就开始做了：圣佩德罗北部的这幢已经废置很久的古老房子。这个地方风景如画，很古老，从一开始就吸引了迪安。它是由他的一个祖先在西班牙人还在统治加利福利亚州的时候建造的。迪安氏中的一位——当时叫迪纳——去了西班牙，带着一个新娘回来。她的名字叫莫雷利娅·戈道尔夫，后来所有的传说都围绕着这个消失已久的女人。</p><p>Even yet there were wrinkled, toothless Mexicans in San Pedro who whispered incredible tales of Morelia Godolfo—she who had never grown old and who had a weirdly evil power over the sea. The Godolfos had been among the proudest families of Granada, but furtive legends spoke of their intercourse with the terrible Moorish sorcerers and necromancers. Morelia, according to these same hinted horrors, had learned uncanny secrets in the black towers of Moorish Spain, and when Dena had brought her as his bride across the sea she had already sealed a pact with dark Powers and had undergone a change.</p><p>尽管如此，在圣佩德罗还是有一些满脸皱纹、没有牙齿的墨西哥人在低声讲述着莫雷利娅·戈道尔夫难以置信的故事——她从未变老，对海洋有着一种古怪的邪恶力量。戈道尔夫家族曾是格拉纳达①最引以为傲的家族之一，但私下里流传着他们与可怕的摩尔人巫师和死灵法师的交情。根据这些恐怖的暗示，莫雷利娅在摩尔人的西班牙的黑塔里发现了离奇的秘密。当迪纳把她作为他的新娘带到海的另一边时，她已经和黑暗力量签下了契约，并且经历了变化。</p><p>[①：格拉纳达，Granada，是西班牙安达卢西亚自治区格拉那达省的省会]</p><p>So ran the tales, and they further told of Morelia’s life in the old San Pedro house. Her husband had lived for ten years or more after the marriage, but rumors said that he no longer possessed a soul.</p><p>传说就这样开始了，他们进一步讲述了莫雷利娅在圣佩德罗老房子里的生活。她的丈夫婚后活了十年或十年以上，但传闻说他已不再有灵魂了。</p><p>It is certain that his death was very mysteriously hushed up by Morelia Godolfo, who went  on living alone in the great house beside the sea.</p><p>可以肯定的是，他的死被莫雷利娅·戈道尔夫神秘地掩盖了起来，然后又继续在海边的大房子里独居。</p><p>The whispers of the peons were hereafter monstrously augmented. They had to do with the change in Morelia Godolfo, the sorcerous change which caused her to swim far out to sea on moonlit nights so that watchers saw her white body gleaming amidst the spray. Men bold enough to gaze from the cliffs might catch glimpses of her then, sporting with queer sea creatures that gamboled about her in the black waters, nuzzling her with shockingly deformed heads. These creatures were not seals, or any known form of submarine life, it was averred, although sometimes bursts of chuckling, gobbling laughter could be heard. It is said that Morelia Godolfo had swum out there one night, and that she never came back. But thereafter the laughter was louder from afar, and the sporting amidst the black rocks continued, so that the tales of the early peons had been nourished down to the present day.</p><p>从此以后，奴隶们的窃窃私语便强烈地增多了。这与莫雷利娅·戈道尔夫的变化有关，巫术使她在月光皎洁的夜晚游到很远的海上，目击者们看见她洁白的身体在浪花中闪闪发光。那些胆敢从悬崖上往下看的人那时也许能瞥见她，在漆黑的海水中与在她周围跳跃的古怪海洋生物嬉戏，牠们用畸形得吓人的脑袋蹭她。尽管有时能听到一阵阵咯咯嘎嘎的笑声，但可以肯定的是，这些生物不是海豹，或是任何已知的海底生命形态。据说，莫雷利娅·戈道尔夫有天晚上在那儿游泳后，就再也没有回来。但之后远处的笑声更响了，黑色岩石间的嬉戏还在继续，因此，早期奴隶们的传说一直流传至今。</p><p>Such were the legends known to Dean. The facts were sparse and inconclusive. The old house had fallen into decrepitude, and was only occasionally rented through the years. These rentals had been as short as they were infrequent. There was nothing definitely wrong with the house between White’s Point and Point Fermin, but those who had lived there said that the crashing of the surf sounded subtly different when heard through windows that overlooked the sea, and, too, they dreamed unpleasantly. Sometimes the occasional tenants had mentioned with peculiar horror the moonlit nights, when the sea became altogether too clearly visible. At any rate, occupants often vacated the house hastily.</p><p>迪安所知道的就是这些传说。真相是稀疏且不确定的。那幢老房子已经破旧不堪，多年来只偶尔被租过几次。这些房屋的租期跟被租出去的频率一样短。怀特角(White’s Point)和弗明角(Point Fermin)之间的那栋房子绝对没有什么问题，但是住在那儿的人说，当听见能俯瞰大海的窗户外听到海浪拍打的声音时，声音听起来会有细微的不同，并且，他们也会做一些不愉快的梦。有时，偶尔租客特别恐惧地提到，在月光皎洁的夜晚，大海变得太过清晰可见。无论如何，租客们经常会匆忙地搬出房子。</p><p>Dean had moved in immediately after inheriting, because he had thought the place ideal for painting the scenes he loved. He had learned the legend and the facts behind it later, and by this time his dreams had started.</p><p>迪安在继承遗产之后便立刻搬了进去，因为他认为这个地方很适合画他喜欢的风景。他后来知道了这背后的传说与真相，到这时他的梦已经开始了。</p><p>At first they had been conventional enough, though, oddly, all centered about the sea which he loved. But it was not the sea he loved that he knew in sleep.</p><p>一开始它们都是很常规的，不过，奇怪的是，它们全都以他所热爱的大海为中心。但他在睡梦中所认识的并不是他所热爱的大海。</p><p>The Gorgons lived in his dreams. Scylla writhed hideously across dark and surging waters, where harpies flew screaming. Weird creatures crawled sluggishly up from the black, inky depths where eyeless, bloated sea beasts dwelt. Gigantic and terrible leviathans leapt and plunged while monstrous serpents squirmed a strange obeisance to a mocking moon. Foul and hidden horrors of the sea’s depths engulfed him in sleep.</p><p>戈耳工②在他梦里生活，哈耳庇埃③尖叫着掠过黑暗汹涌的水面，在那里，斯库拉④令人厌恶地扭动着。怪异的生物缓缓从漆黑的深处爬上，那里住着无眼臃肿的海兽。可怕的庞然海兽跃来跃去，畸形巨蛇向嘲讽之月蠕动着奇怪的敬礼。邪秽隐秘的海底恐怖在睡梦中吞没了他。</p><p>[②：戈耳工，Gorgons，或者译作蛇发女妖、高更、意为可怕的，另有人谓为高声咆哮的。在希腊神话中，是三个长有尖牙，头生毒蛇的恐怖女妖，她们当中的代表就是最小的那个美杜莎。]</p><p>[③：哈耳庇埃，harpies，居住在哈耳庇埃岛(Harpies)上的鸟身女妖，长有少女头，长长的爪和因饥饿而苍白的脸。是神祗派来折磨一个叫菲纽斯(Phineus)的人，宙斯使菲纽斯失去视力，只要膳食出现，哈耳庇埃们就俯冲下去，把食物抢走。]</p><p>[④：斯库拉，Scylla，是希腊神话中吞吃水手的女海妖。她的身体有六个头十二只脚，并且有猫的尾巴。]</p><p>This was bad enough, but it was only a prelude. The dreams began to change. It was almost as though the first few formed a definite setting for the greater terrors to come. From the mythic images of old sea gods another vision emerged. It was inchoate at first, taking definite form and meaning very slowly over a period of several weeks. And it was this dream which Dean now feared.</p><p>这已经够糟糕了，但这仅是一个序幕。梦境开始改变，似乎头几个梦已为更大的恐怖形成了个确定的环境。从古老海神的神话形象中，另一种幻象浮现了。刚开始，它在几个星期的时间里缓慢地形成了具体的形式和意义。迪安现在害怕的正是这个梦境。</p><p>It had occurred generally just before he awoke—a vision of green, translucent light, in which dark shadows swam slowly. Night after night the limpid emerald glow grew brighter, and the shadows twisted into a more visible horror. These were never clearly seen, although their amorphous heads held a strangely repellent recognizable quality for Dean.</p><p>这一切都发生在他醒来之前——一种绿色，透明的光，黑影在其中缓缓地游动。夜复一夜，那清澈的翡翠辉光越来越亮，阴影扭曲成更明显的恐怖。这些东西从来没有被清楚地看见过，尽管牠们无定形的脑袋对迪安而言有一种奇怪的、令人厌恶的、可辨认的特征。</p><p>Presently, in this dream of his, the shadow-creatures would move aside as though to permit the passage of another. Swimming into the green haze would come a coiling shape—whether similar to the rest or not Dean could not tell, for his dream always ended there. The approach of this last shape always caused him to awake in a nightmare paroxysm of terror.</p><p>不久，在他的梦中，这些阴影生物就会朝一旁移动，似乎在允许其他存在的通过。游进绿色的朦胧，会迎上一个螺旋的阴影——是否与其他存在相似，迪安也说不上来，因为他的梦总是在那里终止。他一靠近最后那个阴影，总要从可怕的恐怖中惊醒。</p><p>He dreamt of being somewhere under the sea, amidst swimming shadows with deformed heads; and each night one particular shadow was coming closer and closer.</p><p>他梦见自己在海底的某个地方，处于游来游去、有着畸形脑袋的阴影之中，每晚都离一个特别的阴影越来越近。</p><p>***</p><p>Each day, now, when he awoke with the cold sea-wind of early dawn blowing through the windows, he would lie in a lazy, languid mood till long past daybreak. When he rose these days he felt inexplicably tired, and he could not paint. This particular morning the sight of his haggard face in the mirror had forced him to visit a physician. But Doctor Hedwig had not been helpful.</p><p>现在，每一天当他醒来时，清晨冰冷的海风从窗户吹进来，他就无精打采地躺着，直到天亮很久以后。这些天来，当他站起来的时候，就感到莫名其妙的疲倦，他不能画画了。今天早晨，他一看到镜子里自己那张憔悴的脸，就不得不去看医生。但海德维格医生起不到什么帮助。</p><p>Nevertheless Dean filled the prescription on the way home. A swallow of the bitter, brownish tonic strengthened him somewhat, but as he parked his car the feeling of depression settled down on him again. He walked up to the house still puzzled and strangely afraid.</p><p>尽管如此，迪安还是在回家路上按照处方抓了药。他咽了一口带点苦味的褐色补药，精神稍微振作了一些，但当他把车停好时，那种沮丧的感觉又笼罩了他。他走到那所房子前，仍然感到困惑和莫名的恐惧。</p><p>Under the door was a telegram. Dean read it with a puzzled frown.</p><p>门底下有一封电报。迪安不解地皱着眉头读着。</p><p>JUST LEARNED YOU ARE LIVING IN SAN PEDRO HOUSE STOP VITALLY IMPORTANT YOU VACATE IMMEDIATELY STOP SHOW THIS CABLE TO DOCTOR MAKOTO YAMADA 17 BUENA STREET SAN PEDRO STOP AM RETURNING VIA AIRPLANE STOP SEE YAMADA TODAY</p><p>刚获悉你住在圣佩德罗之屋 至关重要你立刻离开 把这电报给圣佩德罗布埃纳街17号的山田诚医生 我正乘飞机返回 今天见山田去</p><p>MICHAEL LEIGH</p><p>迈克尔·利</p><p>Dean read the message again, and a flash of remembrance came to him. Michael Leigh was his uncle, but he had not seen the man for years. Leigh had been a puzzle to the family; he was an occultist, and spent most of his time delving in far corners of the earth. Occasionally he dropped from sight for long periods of time. The cable Dean held was sent from Calcutta, and he supposed that Leigh had recently emerged from some spot in the interior of India to learn of Dean’s inheritance.</p><p>迪安又读了一遍信，他忽然想起了什么。迈克尔·利是他的叔叔，但他已经很久没有见过这个人了。利一直是家中的一个谜;他是一个神秘主义者，大部分时间都在探索地球上遥远的角落，他偶尔会消失很长一段时间。迪安收到的电报来自加尔各答，他猜想利最近刚从印度内陆的某个地方出来，得知了迪安的遗产。</p><p>Dean searched his mind. He recalled now that there had been some family quarrel about this very house years ago. The details were no longer clear, but he remembered that Leigh demanded the San Pedro house be razed. Leigh had given no sane reasons, and when the request was refused he had dropped out of sight for a time. And now came this inexplicable cablegram.</p><p>迪安思考着，他现在回想起来，几年前有一些家族争吵就围绕着这幢房子。细节已记不太清了，但他记得利强烈要求要把圣佩德罗的房子夷为平地。利没有给出任何合理的动机，当他的要求被拒时，他消失了一段时间，现在又来了这莫名其妙的电报。</p><p>Dean was tired from his long drive, and the unsatisfactory interview with the doctor had irritated him more than he had realized. Nor was he in the mood to follow his uncle’s cabled request and undertake the long journey to Buena Street, which was miles away. The drowsiness which he felt, however, was normal healthy exhaustion, unlike the languor of recent weeks. The tonic he had taken was of some value after all.</p><p>迪安因长途驾车而疲惫，对医生的不满意的采访使他比他所意识到的更恼火。他也没有心思听从叔叔的电报要求，长途跋涉到几英里外的布埃纳街去。然而，他感到的困倦是正常健康的精疲力竭，不像最近几个星期那样的衰弱无力。他吃的补药毕竟还是有些价值的。</p><p>He dropped into his favorite chair by the window that overlooked the sea, rousing himself to watch the flaming colors of the sunset. Presently the sun dropped below the horizon, and gray dusk crept in. Stars appeared, and far to the north he could see the dim lights of the gambling ships off Venice. The mountains shut off his view of San Pedro, but a diffused pale glow in that direction told him that the New Barbary was wakening into roaring, brawling life. Slowly the face of the Pacific brightened. A full moon was rising above the San Pedro hills.</p><p>他坐在可以俯瞰大海的窗边，他最喜欢的那把的椅子里，激励自己去看落日火红的色彩。不久，太阳沉下地平线，灰蒙暮色悄然降临，众星现出。在遥远的北方，他可以看到驶离威尼斯的赌船上昏暗的灯光。群山挡住了他的视野，使其看不见圣佩德罗，但那方向弥漫着一种暗淡微光，告诉他新巴巴里(New Barbary)正在苏醒，进入放纵喧嚷的生活。太平洋的表面慢慢亮了起来。一轮满月从圣佩德罗山上升起。</p><p>For a long time Dean sat quietly by the window, his pipe forgotten in his hand, staring down at the slow swells of the ocean, which seemed to pulse with a mighty and alien life. Gradually drowsiness crept up and overwhelmed him. Just before he dropped into the abyss of sleep there flashed into his mind da Vinci’s saying: “The two most wonderful things in the world are a woman’s smile and the motion of mighty waters.”</p><p>迪安在窗边静坐了很久，都忘了手里拿着烟斗。他低头凝视着大海缓缓涌起的波浪，似乎有一种强大而陌生的生命在跳动。倦意逐渐爬了上来，将他压倒。就在他坠入睡眠的深渊之前，达芬奇的那句话闪过他的脑海："女人的微笑与汹涌的水流是世界上最美妙的两样事物。"</p><p>He dreamed, and this time it was a different dream. At first only blackness, and a roaring and thundering as of angry seas, and oddly mingled with this was the hazy thought of a woman’s smile—and a woman’s lips—pouting lips, softly alluring—but strangely the lips were not red—no! They were very pale, bloodless, like the lips of a thing that had long rested beneath the sea—</p><p>他入了梦，这次是一个与众不同的梦。起初，只有一片黑暗，还有怒海的咆哮与雷鸣，与此同时，还夹杂着对一个女人微笑的朦胧想象——一个女人的嘴唇——撅起的唇，温柔的诱惑——但奇怪的是双唇并不是红色的——不！它们非常的苍白，毫无血色，像是一个在海底憩息了很久的东西的嘴唇——</p><p>The misty vision changed, and for a flashing instant Dean seemed to see the green and silent place of his earlier visions. The shadowy black shapes were moving more quickly behind the veil, but this picture was of but a second’s duration. It flashed out and vanished, and Dean was standing alone on a beach, a beach he recognized in his dream—the sandy cove beneath the house.</p><p>模糊的视野改变了，刹那间，迪安似乎看到了他先前想象的绿色与寂静之地。朦胧的黑影在遮掩后面移动得更快了，但这画面只有一秒钟的时间，它闪出又消失了。迪安独自站在一片海滩上，一个他在梦中认出了的海滩——房子下面的沙湾。</p><p>The salt breeze blew coldly across his face, and the sea glistened like silver in the moonlight. A faint splash told of a sea thing that broke the surface of the waters. To the north the sea washed against the rugged surface of the cliff, barred and speckled with black shadows. Dean felt a sudden, inexplicable impulse to move in that direction. He yielded.</p><p>咸咸微风无情地吹过他的脸，海面在月光下闪着银光。一阵轻微的溅水声说明有个海洋生物冲出了水面。北面的海水冲刷着粗糙的悬崖表面，形成了斑驳的黑影。迪安突然感到一种无法解释的冲动，想朝那个方向走去。他屈服了。</p><p>As he clambered over the rocks he was suddenly conscious of a strange sensation, as though keen eyes were focused upon him—eyes that watched and warned! Vaguely in his mind rose up the gaunt face of his uncle, Michael Leigh, the deep-set eyes glowing. But swiftly this was gone, and he found himself before a deeper niche of blackness in the cliff face. Into it he knew he must go.</p><p>当他爬过岩石时，他突然有一种奇怪的感觉，好似有双敏锐的眼睛在盯着他——那眼睛在观察着，并发出警告！他的叔叔迈克尔·利憔悴的面孔模糊地浮现在他脑中，其深陷的眼睛闪着光。但这一切很快就消失了，他发现自己面前是悬崖峭壁上一个更深的黑暗缝隙。他知道他必须进去。</p><p>He squeezed himself between two jutting points of rock and found himself in utter, dismal darkness. Yet somehow he was conscious that he was in a cave, and he could hear water lapping nearby. All about him was a musty salt odor of sea decay, the fetid smell of useless ocean caves and holds of ancient ships. He stepped forward, and, as the floor shelved sharply downwards, stumbled and fell headlong into icy, shallow water. He felt, rather than saw, a flicker of swift movement, and then abruptly hot lips were pressed against his.</p><p>他挤进两个突出的岩石尖之间，发现自己处在全然的阴暗之中。但他不知怎的意识到自己是在一个洞穴里，并且他能听到附近水拍打的声音。他周围弥漫着一股海水退潮时发出的发霉咸味，还有无用的海洋洞穴以及古代船只货舱发出的恶臭。他向前迈了一步，地面急剧向下倾斜，令其绊跌，一头栽进了冰冷的浅水中。他感到，而不是看到，有一种迅速的移动，然后火辣的双唇突然压在他的嘴上。</p><p>Human lips, Dean thought, at first.</p><p>人类的嘴唇，迪安起初想。</p><p>He lay on his side in the chill water, his lips against those responsive ones. He could see nothing, for all was lost in the blackness of the cave. The unearthly lure of those invisible lips thrilled through him.</p><p>He responded to them, pressed them fiercely, gave them what they were avidly seeking. The unseen waters crawled against the rocks, whispering warning.</p><p>他侧身躺在冰冷的水中，嘴唇贴着那些敏感的嘴唇。他什么也看不见，一切都迷失在洞穴的黑暗中。那些无形之唇的神秘诱惑使他浑身发抖。他对它们作出了反应，狂热地压着他们，给予它们所热切寻求的。看不见的水拍打着岩石，低声警告着。</p><p>And in that kiss strangeness flooded him. He felt a shock and a tingling go through him, and then a thrill of sudden ecstasy, and swift on its heels came horror. Black loathsome foulness seemed to wash his brain, indescribable but fearfully real, making him shudder with nausea. It was as though unutterable evil were pouring into his body, his mind, his very soul, through the blasphemous kiss on his lips. He felt loathsome, contaminated. He fell back. He sprang to his feet.</p><p>在那吻中，一种怪异感淹没了他。他感到一阵震惊与麻刺穿过了他，接着是一阵突如其来的狂喜，紧接着是恐惧。令人憎恶的黑色污秽似乎在冲刷他的大脑，难以形容却真实得可怕，使他反胃得发抖。通过他唇上的亵渎之吻，仿佛有一种说不出的邪恶正注入他的身体，思想，以及灵魂。他觉得自己被玷污了，十分讨厌。他向后跌去，随后跳了起来。</p><p>And Dean saw, for the first time, the ghastly thing he had kissed, as the sinking moon sent a pale shaft of radiance creeping through the cave mouth. For something rose up before him, a serpentine and seal-like bulk that coiled and twisted and moved towards him, glistening with foul slime; and Dean screamed and turned to flee with nightmare fear tearing at his brain, hearing behind him a quiet splashing as though some bulky creature had slid back into the water—</p><p>当一道来自下沉月亮的苍白光芒慢慢爬进洞口，迪安第一次看到，他吻过的那个可怕的东西。他面前出现了一个蛇形的，海豹模样的庞然大物盘绕着，扭动着，向他爬去，还闪着肮脏粘液的反光。迪安尖叫着转身逃跑，可怕的恐惧撕扯其大脑，他听到身后传来一阵轻轻的水声，好像有什么大体积的生物又滑回水中——</p><p>2. A Visit from Doctor Yamada</p><p>2. 山田医生的来访</p><p>He awoke. He was still in his chair before the window, and the moon was paling before the grayness of dawn. He was shaken with nausea, sick and shuddering with the shocking realism of his dream. His clothing was drenched with perspiration, and his heart hammered furiously. An immense lethargy seemed to have overwhelmed him, making it an intense effort to rise from the chair and stagger to a couch, on which he flung himself to doze fitfully for several hours.</p><p>他醒了，仍然在窗边的椅子上，月亮在灰色的黎明前渐渐变白。他对自己梦感到憎恶与恶心，并对那真实感而战栗不已。衣服被汗水浸湿了，他的心脏猛烈地跳动着。巨大的困乏似乎要将其压倒，他费了好大劲才从椅子上站起来，踉跄着走向沙发，他在那上面断断续续地小睡了几个小时。</p><p>A sharp pealing of the doorbell roused him. He still felt weak and dizzy, but the frightening lethargy had somewhat abated. When Dean opened the door, a Japanese man standing on the porch began a bobbing little bow, a gesture that was abruptly arrested as the sharp black eyes focused on Dean’s face. A little hiss of indrawn breath came from the visitor.</p><p>一阵刺耳的门铃声把他惊醒了。他仍然感到虚弱和头晕，但可怕的困乏已有所减轻。当迪安打开门时，一位站在门廊上的日本人微微鞠了一躬，当一双锐利的黑眼睛盯着迪安的脸时，这一动作停了下来。来访者发出轻微的嘶声。</p><p>Dean said irritably, “Well? Do you want to see me?”</p><p>迪安暴躁地说：“嗯?你想看我?”</p><p>The other was still staring, his thin face sallow beneath a stiff thatch of gray hair. He was a small, slender man, with his face covered with a fine-spun web of wrinkles. After a pause he said, “I am Doctor Yamada.”</p><p>对方还在盯着他，他那瘦削的脸在一绺硬硬的白发下显得灰黄。他身材瘦小，脸上布满了细密的皱纹。停顿之后，他说：“我是山田医生。”</p><p>Dean frowned, puzzled. Abruptly he remembered his uncle’s cable of the day before. An odd, unreasonable irritation began to mount within him, and he said, more brusquely than he had intended, “This isn’t a professional call, I hope. I’ve already—”</p><p>迪安皱了皱眉，有些疑惑。他突然想起前一天他叔叔的电报。他心里开始产生一种莫名其妙、毫无道理的愤怒，他比他预想的更唐突地说：“我希望这不是一个职业拜访。我已经——”</p><p>“Your uncle—you are Mr. Dean?—cabled me. He was rather worried.” Doctor Yamada glanced around almost furtively.</p><p>"你的叔叔——你是迪安先生吗？——给我发了电报。他非常担心。"山田医生几乎是偷偷地扫视四周。</p><p>Dean felt distaste stir within him, and his irritation increased.</p><p>迪安感到内心一阵厌恶的搅动，他的怒火更大了。</p><p>“My uncle is rather eccentric, I’m afraid. There’s nothing for him to worry about. I’m sorry you had your trip for nothing.”</p><p>“恐怕我的叔叔很古怪。他没有什么好担心的。我很遗憾你白跑了一趟。”</p><p>Doctor Yamada did not seem to take offense at Dean’s attitude. Rather, a strange expression of sympathy showed for a moment on his small face.</p><p>山田医生似乎对迪安的态度不以为然。更确切地说，他那张小脸上片刻流露出了一种奇怪的同情。</p><p>“Do you mind if I come in?” he asked, and moved forward confidently.</p><p>“你建议我进来吗？”他问道，信心十足地向前走去。</p><p>Short of barring his way, Dean had no means of stopping him, and ungraciously led his guest to the room where he had spent the night, motioning him to a chair while he busied himself with a coffeepot.</p><p>除了挡住他的路，迪安没有办法阻止他，他粗鲁地把他的客人领进他过夜的房间，示意他坐到椅子上，自己忙着拿咖啡壶。</p><p>Yamada sat motionless, silently watching Dean. Then without preamble he said, “Your uncle is a great man, Mr. Dean.“</p><p>山田一动不动地坐着，默默地看着迪安。接着，他不做铺垫地说：“迪安先生，你的叔叔是个伟人。”</p><p>Dean made a noncommittal gesture. “I have seen him only once.” “He is one of the greatest occultists of this day. I, too, have studied psychic lore, but beside your uncle I am a novice.”</p><p>迪安摆了个意义不明的手势。</p><p>“我只见过他一次。”</p><p>“他是当今最伟大的神秘主义者之一。我也学过有关超自然的学问，但跟你叔叔比起来，我是个新手。”</p><p>Dean said, "He is eccentric. Occultism, as you term it, has never interested me.”</p><p>迪安说：“他是个怪人。你所说的神秘学，我从来就不感兴趣。”</p><p>The little Japanese watched him impassively. “You make a common error, Mr. Dean. You consider occultism a hobby for cranks. No”—he held up a slender hand—“your disbelief is written in your face. Well, it is understandable. It is an anachronism, an attitude handed down from the earliest times, when scientists were called alchemists and sorcerers burned for making pacts with the devil. But actually there are no sorcerers, no witches. Not in the sense that man understands these terms. There are men and women who have acquired mastery over certain sciences which are not wholly subject to mundane physical laws.”</p><p>小个子日本人冷漠地看着他。</p><p>“迪安先生，你犯了一个常见错误。你认为神秘学是怪人的爱好。错了。”——他举起了一只苗条的手——“你的脸上写满了怀疑。好吧，这是可以理解的。这是一种时代错误，一种从最早的时代就流传下来的态度，当时科学家被称为炼金术士和巫师，因与恶魔立约而被烧死。但实际上没有巫师，没有魔女。这些术语的意义不是人们所理解的那样。有些人已经掌握了某些不完全受俗世物理定律支配的科学。”</p><p>There was a little smile of disbelief on Dean’s face. Yamada went on quietly. “You do not believe because you do not understand. There are not many who can comprehend, or who wish to comprehend, this greater science which is not bound by earthly laws. But here is a problem for you, Mr. Dean. ” A little spark of irony flickered in the black eyes. “Can you tell me how I know you have suffered from nightmares recently?”</p><p>迪安脸上露出一丝难以置信的笑容。山田平静地继续说：“你不相信是因为你不能理解。没有多少人能够理解，也没有多少人想去理解这门不受俗世定律约束的伟大科学。但迪安先生，现在有一个问题要问你。”</p><p>他的黑眼睛里掠过一丝讽刺的光芒。</p><p>“你能告诉我我是怎么知道你最近一直在忍受噩梦之苦吗?”</p><p>Dean jerked around and stood staring. Then he smiled.</p><p>迪安猛然转过身来，瞪着眼睛站在那里。然后他笑了。</p><p>“As it happens, I know the answer, Doctor Yamada. You physicians have a way of hanging together—and I must have let something slip to Doctor Hedwig yesterday.” His tone was offensive, but Yamada merely shrugged slightly.</p><p>“碰巧，我知道答案，山田先生。你们医生有一种团结的方式——我昨天一定是向海德维格医生透露了什么。他的语气很无礼，但山田只是微微耸了耸肩。</p><p>“Do you know your Homer?” he asked, apparently irrelevantly, and at Dean’s surprised nod went on, “And Proteus? You remember the Old Man of the Sea who possessed the power of changing his shape? I do not wish to strain your credulity, Mr. Dean, but for a long time students of the dark lore have known that behind this legend there exists a very terrible truth. All the tales of spirit possession, of reincarnation, even the comparatively innocuous experiments in thought transference, point to the truth. Why do you suppose folklore abounds with tales of men who have been able to change themselves into beasts—werewolves, hyenas, tigers, the seal-men of the Eskimos? Because these tales are founded on truth!”</p><p>“你知道你们的荷马吗？”他问，显然是不相干的，迪安吃惊地点了点头，“那普洛透斯④呢？你还记得那个拥有改变形状能力的海洋老人吗?我不想使你过于轻信，迪安先生，但很长一段时间以来，学习黑暗传说的学者都知道，在这个传说背后存在着一个非常可怕的真相。所有关于灵魂附体、转世、甚至是相对无害的思想转移实验的故事都指向真理。你猜测为什么民间传说中有很多人能把自己变成野兽的故事呢——狼人，土狼，老虎，爱斯基摩的海豹人?因为这些传说都基于真相！”</p><p>[⑤：普洛透斯，Proteus，是希腊神话中的一个早期海神，荷马所称的“海洋老人”之一]</p><p>"I do not mean,” he went on, “that the actual physical metamorphosis of the body is possible, so far as we know. But it has long been known that the intelligence—the mind—of an adept can be transferred to the brain and body of a satisfactory subject. Animals’ brains are weak, lacking the power of resistance. But men are different, unless there are certain circumstances—”</p><p>“我并不是说，”他继续说下去，“据我们所知，身体的世纪变形是可能的。但人们早就知道一位能手的天分——精神——可以转移到一个符合其要求之对象的大脑与身体中。动物的大脑很脆弱，缺乏抵抗力。但人是不同的，除非有某些情况——”</p><p>As he hesitated, Dean proffered the Japanese a cup of coffee— coffee was generally brewing in the percolator these days—and Yamada accepted it with a formal little bow of acknowledgment. Dean drank his coffee in three hasty gulps, and poured more. Yamada, after a polite sip, put the cup aside and leaned forward earnestly.</p><p>当他犹豫时，迪安递给日本人一杯咖啡——目前咖啡一般都是用滤壶煮的——山田接受了，正式地鞠躬致谢。迪安匆忙地喝了三口咖啡，随后又倒入更多。山田礼貌地喝了一小口后，把杯子放在一边，诚挚地向前倾。</p><p>“I must ask you to make your mind receptive, Mr. Dean. Don’t allow your conventional ideas of life to influence you in this matter. It is vitally to your interest that you listen carefully to me, and understand. Then—perhaps—”</p><p>“迪安先生，我得请你接受我的意见。不要让你传统的生活观念在这件事上影响了你。这对你的利益至关重要。你要仔细听我说，并且理解。然后——也许——”</p><p>He hesitated, and again threw that oddly furtive glance at the window.</p><p>他犹豫着，又一次用那种奇怪的鬼祟目光望着窗户。</p><p>“Life in the sea has followed different lines from life on land. Evolution has followed a different course. In the great deeps of the ocean, life utterly alien to ours has been discovered—luminous creatures which burst when exposed to the lighter pressure of the air—and in those tremendous depths forms of life completely inhuman have been developed, life forms that the uninitiated mind may think impossible. In Japan, an island country, we have known of these sea-dwellers for generations. Your English writer, Arthur Machen, has told a deep truth in his statement that man, afraid of these strange beings, has attributed to them beautiful or pleasantly grotesque forms which in reality they do not possess. Thus we have the nereids and oceanids—but nevertheless man could not fully disguise the true foulness of these creatures. Therefore there are legends of the Gorgons, of Scylla and the harpies—and, significantly, of the mermaids and their soullessness. No doubt you know the mermaid tale—how they long to steal the soul of a man, and draw it out by means of their kiss.”</p><p>“海洋生物与陆地生物遵循不同的路线。进化遵循了一条不同的道路。在海洋深处，发现了与我们完全陌生的生命——发光的生物，当牠们暴露在较轻的空气压力下就会爆炸——在那些极其深的地方，已经发展出了完全非人类的生命形式，是那些缺少经验的人认为不可能的生命形态。在日本这个岛国，我们几代人以前就知道这些海洋住民(sea-dwellers)。你们的英语作家——亚瑟·梅琴，他在他的陈述中道出了一个深刻的真理，那就是人类害怕这些奇怪的存在，却把牠们赋予了美丽的或令人愉快的怪诞模样，而这些形态在现实中并不具备。这样，我们就有了涅瑞伊得斯和俄刻阿尼得斯——然而，人类无法完全掩盖这些生物真正的邪恶。因此，有关于戈耳工、斯库拉与哈耳庇埃的传说——更重要的是，美人鱼及牠们的离魂术(soullessness)。毫无疑问你知道美人鱼的传说——牠们多么渴望偷走一个人的灵魂，通过牠们的吻将其取出。”</p><p>Dean was at the window now, his back to the Japanese. As Yamada paused he said tonelessly, “Go on.”</p><p>迪安现在站在窗口，背对着日本人。当山田停顿时，他沉闷地说:“继续。”</p><p>“I have reason to believe,” Yamada went on very quietly, “that Morelia Godolfo, the woman from Alhambra, was not fully—human. She left no issue. These things never have children—they cannot.”</p><p>“我有理由相信，”山田非常平静地说，“莫雷利娅·戈道尔夫，这个来自阿罕布拉的女人，并非完全的人类。她没有留下任何问题。这些东西永远不会有孩子——牠们不会。”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Dean had turned and was facing the Japanese, his face a ghastly white, the shadows beneath his eyes hideously livid. He repeated harshly, “What do you mean? You can’t frighten me with your tales—if that’s what you’re trying to do. You—my uncle wants me out of this house, for some reason of his own. You’re taking this means of getting me out—aren’t you? Eh?”</p><p>“你这是什么意思?”迪安转过身来，面对着日本人，脸色惨白，眼睛下面的阴影青灰得可怕。他严厉地重复,“你这是什么意思?你无法用你的传说吓到我——如果那是你尝试对我做的事。你——我叔叔想我离开这幢房子，是出于他自己的原因。你要用这个方法把我弄出去——不是吗？嗯?”</p><p>“You must leave this house,” Yamada said. “Your uncle is coming, but he may not be in time. Listen to me: These creatures—the sea-dwellers—envy man. Sunlight, and warm fires, and the fields of earth—things which the sea-dwellers cannot normally possess. These things—and love. You remember what I said about mind transference. This is the only way these things can attain that which they desire, and know the love of man or woman. Sometimes—not very often—one of these creatures succeeds in possessing itself of a human body. They watch always. When there is a wreck, they go there, like vultures to a feast. They can swim phenomenally fast. When a man is drowning, the defenses of his mind are down and sometimes the sea-dwellers can thus acquire a human body. There have been tales of men saved from wrecks who ever after were oddly changed.”</p><p>“你必须离开这个房子，”山田说。“你的叔叔正在赶来，但他可能来不及了。听我说：这些生物——海洋住民们——嫉妒人类。日光，温暖的火，地球的平原——海洋住民通常不能拥有的东西。这些东西——以及爱情。你还记得我说过的关于精神转移。只有这样，牠们才能得到渴求的这些东西，并且熟悉了男人或女人的爱。有时——不是经常——这些生物中有某个成功地拥有了人体。牠们总是观察。当有船只失事时，他们就像秃鹫赴宴一样去那里。他们游泳游得特别快。当有人落水时，其精神防线是薄弱的，有时海洋住民们因此就可获得一个人类的身体。曾经有过这样的传说，有人从沉船里被救了出来，但后来却发生了奇怪的变化。”</p><p>“Morelia Godolfo was one of these creatures! The Godolfos knew much of the dark lore but used it for evil purposes—the so-called black magic. And it was, I think, through this that a sea-dweller gained power to usurp the brain and body of the woman. A transference took place. The mind of the sea-dweller took possession of Morelia Godolfo’s body and the intelligence of the original Morelia was forced into the terrible form of that creature of the abyss. In time the human body of the woman died and the usurping mind returned to its original shell. The intelligence of Morelia Godolfo was then ejected from its temporary prison and left homeless. That is true death.”</p><p>“莫雷利娅·戈道尔夫是那些生物中的一个！戈道尔夫氏们知道很多黑暗传说，却把它用于邪恶的目的——所谓的黑魔法。我想，正是通过这个，一个海洋住民得到了能力，篡夺了这女人的大脑和身体。一场转移发生了。海洋住民的精神占据了莫雷利娅·戈道尔夫的身体，最初莫雷利娅的灵魂被迫使进入深渊生物的可怕形态中。过了一段时间，女人的身体死了，篡夺的精神又回到了它原来的躯壳里。莫雷利娅·戈道尔夫的灵魂随后被驱逐出临时监狱，无处可归。这才是真正的死亡。”</p><p>Dean shook his head slowly as though in denial but did not speak. And inexorably Yamada kept on.</p><p>迪安缓缓摇了摇头，似乎是在否认，但没有说话。山田决绝地继续说下去。</p><p>“For years, generations, since then she has dwelt in the sea, waiting. Her power is strongest here, where she once lived. But, as I told you, only under unusual circumstances can this—transference take place. The tenants of this house might be troubled with dreams, but that would be all. The evil being had no power to steal their bodies. Your uncle knew that, or he would have insisted that the place be immediately destroyed. He did not foresee that you would ever live here.”</p><p>“多少年了，多少代了。从那以后，她一直住在海中，等待着。她的力量在这里，曾经住过的地方最为强大。但是，正如我告诉你的，只有在不寻常的情况下，这种转移才会发生。这所房子的房客可能会被梦所困扰，但仅此而已。邪恶的存在没有力量去盗取他们的身体。你叔叔知道这件事，否则他会坚持要马上把这个地方毁掉。他没有预见你会住在这里。”</p><p>The little Japanese bent forward, and his eyes were twin points of black light.</p><p>小个子日本人向前弯下腰，他的眼睛是两个黑点。</p><p>“You do not need to tell me what you have undergone in the past month. I know. The sea-dweller has power over you. For one thing, there are bonds of blood, even though you are not directly descended from her. And your love for the ocean—your uncle spoke of that. You live here alone with your paintings and your imaginative fancies; you see no one else. You are an ideal victim, and it was easy for that sea horror to become en rapport with you. Even now you show the stigmata.”</p><p>“你不必告诉我你在过去一月中经历了什么，我知道，海洋住民能控制你。一方面，即使你不是她的直系后代，你们之间还是有血缘关系的。以及你对海洋的热爱——你的叔叔谈过这个。你独自带着你的画作与幻想住在这，你看不到其他人。你是一个理想的受害者，你很容易就能与海之恐惧建立起融洽的联系。你现在甚至身体状况都显得不好了。”</p><p>***</p><p>Dean was silent, his face a pale shadow amidst the darker ones in the corners of the room. What was the man trying to tell him? What were these hints leading up to?</p><p>迪安沉默了，他的脸在房间角落里的黑暗阴影中显得苍白。这人想告诉他什么?这些暗示意味着什么?</p><p>“Remember what I have said.” Doctor Yamada’s voice was fanatically earnest. “That creature wants you for your youth—your soul. She has lured you in sleep, with visions of Poseidonis, the twilight grottoes in the deep. She has sent you beguiling visions at first, to hide what she was doing. She has drained your life forces, weakened your resistance, waiting until she is strong enough to take possession of your brain.</p><p>“记住我说的话。”山田医生的声音狂热地认真。“那个生物想要你的青春——你的灵魂。她用波塞冬尼斯(Poseidonis)的幻象，黄昏深处的石窟将你诱入梦乡。起初，她向你送去了迷惑人的幻想，来掩盖其所行之事。她耗尽了你的生命力，削弱了你的抵抗力，一直等到她足够强大，能够控制你的大脑。”</p><p>“I have told you what she wants—what all these hybrid horrors raven for. She will reveal herself to you in time, and when her will is strong upon you in slumber, you will do her bidding. She will take you down into the deep, and show you the kraken- fouled gulfs where these things bide. You will go willingly, and that will be your doom. She may lure you to their feasts there— the feasts they hold upon the drowned things they find floating from wrecked ships. And you will live such madness in your sleep because she rules you. And then—then, when you have become weak enough, she will have her desire. The sea-thing will usurp your body and walk once more on earth. And you will go down into the darkness where once you dwelt in dreams, forever. Unless I am mistaken, you have already seen enough to know that I speak truth. I think that this terrible moment is not so far off, and I warn you that alone you cannot hope to resist the evil. Only with the aid of your uncle and me—”</p><p>“我已经告诉过你她想要什么——这些混合恐怖的侵扰到底是为了什么。她会适时地出现在你面前，当其意志在你熟睡时变得坚强时，你就会听从她的命令。她会将你带到深处，带你去看被海怪污染的海湾，那些东西的居所。你会心甘情愿地前往，那将是你的厄运。她可能会把你引诱到他们的宴会上——他们举行宴会的时候，会看到他们在失事之船上寻到的沉没之物。你会在睡梦中如此疯狂，是因为她掌控着你。并且然后——然后，当你足够虚弱时，她就会满足自己的愿望。那海兽将夺取你的躯体，再次在地表上行走。你将下到黑暗中去，就是你从前在梦里停留的地方，直到永远。你已经看够了，除非我错了，你知道我说的是真的。我想这个可怕的时刻已经不远了，我警告你，你无法独自抵抗邪恶。只有在你叔叔和我的帮助下——”</p><p>Doctor Yamada stood up. He moved forward and confronted the dazed youth face to face. In a low voice he asked, “In your dreams— has the thing kissed you?"</p><p>山田医生站了起来，他向前走去，与那个茫然的青年脸对着脸。他低声问道：“在你的梦中——那东西亲吻过你了吗？”</p><p>For a heartbeat there was utter silence. Dean opened his mouth to speak, and then a curious little warning note seemed to sound in his brain. It rose, like the quiet roaring of a conch shell, and a vague nausea assailed him.</p><p>一阵心跳过后，是完全的寂静。迪安张开嘴想说话，一个小小的古怪警告似乎在他的脑子里响起。它升起，就像海螺壳发出的安静的呼啸，一阵隐隐的恶心袭上他的心头。</p><p>Almost without volition, he heard himself saying, “No.”</p><p>他几乎没有一点意志，只听见自己说：“没有。”</p><p>Dimly, as though from an incredibly far distance, he heard Yamada suck in his breath, as if surprised. Then the Japanese said, “That is good. Very good. Now listen: Your uncle will be here soon. He has chartered a special plane. Will you be my guest until he arrives?”</p><p>他隐约听到山田吸气的声音，仿佛是从很远的地方传来，似乎很吃惊。然后日本人说：“这是好的。非常好。现在听着：你的叔叔马上就会到这儿，他租了一架专机。在他到来之前，你愿意当我的客人吗?”</p><p>The room seemed to darken before Dean’s eyes. The form of the Japanese was receding, dwindling. Through the window the surf sound came crashing, and it rolled on in waves through Dean’s brain. In its thunder a thin, insistent whispering penetrated.</p><p>房间似乎在迪安眼前变黑了。日本人的身形在后退，在缩小。海浪声从窗外哗啦哗啦地传来，在迪安的脑中摇摆着。在恐吓中，一种微弱的、持续不断的窃窃私语传了进来。</p><p>“Accept,” it murmured. “Accept!” And Dean heard his own voice accept Yamada’s invitation.</p><p>“同意。”它低语着。</p><p>“同意！”迪安听到自己的声音，接受了山田的邀请。</p><p>He seemed incapable of coherent thought. This last dream haunted him—and now Doctor Yamada’s disturbing story—he was ill—that was it!—very ill. He wanted very much to sleep, now. A flood of darkness seemed to wash up and engulf him. Gratefully he allowed it to sweep through his tired head. Nothing existed but the dark, and a restless lapping of unquiet waters.</p><p>他似乎不能连贯地思考。这最后一个梦一直缠绕着他——现在山田医生那令人不安的故事——他病了——仅此而已！——病的很重。他现在想要更多的睡眠，一股黑暗的洪流仿佛要吞没了他。他感激地让它没过疲惫的脑袋。除了黑暗与不平静的水面无休止地拍打，什么也没有。</p><p>Yet he seemed to know, in an odd way, that he was still—some outer part of him—conscious. He strangely realized that he and Doctor Yamada had left the house, were entering a car, and driving a long way. He was—with that strange, external other self—talking casually to the doctor; entering his house in San Pedro; drinking; eating. And all the while his soul, his real being, was buried in waves of blackness.</p><p>但以一种奇怪的方式，他似乎知道，在他身体之外，他仍然神志清醒。他奇怪地意识到他和山田医生已经离开了房子，进入一辆汽车，开了很长一段路。他——与那个陌生的，外表的另一个自我——在同医生随意地交谈，进入他那在圣佩德罗的房屋，吃吃喝喝。与此同时，他的灵魂，他真实的存在，一直被埋没在黑暗的波浪中。</p><p>Finally a bed. From below, the surf seemed to blend into the blackness that engulfed his brain. It spoke to him now, as he rose stealthily and clambered out of the window. The fall jarred his outer self considerably, but he was on the ground outside without injury. He kept in the shadows as he crept away down to the beach—the black, hungry shadows that were like the darkness surging through his soul.</p><p>最后是一张床。自低处，海浪似乎融进吞没他大脑的黑暗之中。它现在正与他对话，他悄悄站了起来，爬出了窗子。这一跤摔得外面的自己相当不适，但他躺在了外面的地上，并没有受伤。当他蹑手蹑脚地走到海滩时，他一直躲在阴影中——那些黑色，饥饿的阴影就像黑暗在他的灵魂里汹涌澎湃。</p><p>3. Three Dreadful Hours</p><p>3.可怕的三小时</p><p>With a shock, he was himself once more—completely. The cold water had done it; the water in which he found himself swimming. He was in the ocean, borne on waves as silver as the lightning that occasionally flashed overhead. He heard thunder, felt the sting of rain. Without wondering about the sudden transition, he swam on, as though fully aware of some unplanned destination. For the first time in over a month he felt fully alive, actually himself. There was a surge of wild elation in him that defied the facts; he no longer seemed to care about his recent illness, the weird warnings of his uncle and Doctor Yamada, and the unnatural darkness that had previously shadowed his mind. In fact, he no longer had to think—it was as though he were being directed in all his movements.</p><p>随着一个冲击，他再一次完全是他自己了。是冷水造成的，他发现自己在水中游泳。他在海中，被像偶尔闪过头顶的闪电一样银光闪闪的海浪托着。他听见了雷声，感受雨的刺痛。他没有对突然的转变感到奇怪，继续向前游去，仿佛完全意识到了某个没有计划的目的地。一个多月来，他第一次觉得自己完全充满活力。他心中涌起一股狂野的喜悦，这是对事实的蔑视，他似乎不再关心他最近的疾病，他的叔叔和山田医生的怪异警告，以及先前笼罩在他心头的不自然的黑暗。事实上，他不必再去想了——他的一举一动似乎都是由他自己控制的。</p><p>He was swimming parallel with the beach now, and with curious detachment he observed that the storm had subsided. A pale, fog-like glow hovered over the lashing waters, and it seemed to beckon.</p><p>他现在和海滩平行地游着，伴随着奇怪的超然感，他注意到风暴已经止息了。一种苍白的、雾一般的光辉在奔腾的水面上盘旋，它似乎在召唤。</p><p>The air was chill, as was the water, and the waves high, yet Dean experienced neither cold nor fatigue. And when he saw the things that waited for him on the rocky beach just ahead, he lost all perception of himself in a crescendo of mounting joy.</p><p>空气很冷，海水同样如此，海浪很高，但迪安既不冷也不累。当他看到前面岩石滩上等着他的东西时，他完全失去了自己的认知力，沉浸在越来越高涨的喜悦之中。</p><p>This was inexplicable, for they were the creatures of his last and wildest nightmares. Even now he did not see them plainly as they sported in the surf, but there were dim suggestions of past horror in their tenebrous outlines. The things were like seals: great, fish-like, bloated monsters with pulpy, shapeless heads. These heads rested on columnar necks that undulated with serpentine ease, and he observed, without any sensation other than curious familiarity, that the heads and bodies of the creatures were a sea-bleached white.</p><p>这是无法解释的，因为它们是他最后最可怕之噩梦的生物。即使现在，他也看不清牠们在浪涛中嬉戏的样子，但在牠们黑暗的轮廓中，隐约可见过去的恐怖。这些东西像是海豹：巨大，像鱼一样的，臃肿的怪物，有着泥状，不定形的头。脑袋长在像圆柱一样的脖子上，脖子像蛇一样起伏着。他注意到，除了古怪的熟悉感之外，没有任何感觉，这些生物的头与身体是被海水漂成的白色。</p><p>Soon he was swimming in among them—swimming with peculiar and disturbing ease. Inwardly he marveled, with a touch of his former feeling, that he was not now horrified by the sea-beasts in the least. Instead, it was almost with a feeling of kinship that he listened to their strange low gruntings and cackles—listened and understood.</p><p>很快他就游进牠们中间——以奇特，且轻松得令人不安的方式游泳。他内心希奇，带着一点以前的感觉，他现在丝毫不害怕海怪了。相反，他几乎是带着一种亲切感来听牠们奇怪的低吟和咯咯的叫声——倾听并且理解。</p><p>He knew what they were saying, and he was not amazed. He was not frightened by what he heard, though the words would have sent abysmal horror through his soul in the previous dreams.</p><p>他知道牠们在说什么，并不感到惊奇。他并没有被他所听到的吓到，尽管在从前的梦中，这些话会使他的灵魂感到极度的恐惧。</p><p>He knew where they were going and what they meant to do when the entire group swam out into the water once more, yet he did not fear. Instead, he felt a strange hunger at the thought of what was to come, a hunger that impelled him to take the lead as the things, with undulant swiftness, glided through the inky waters to the north. They swam with incredible speed, yet it was hours before a sea coast loomed up through the murk, lit by a blinding flare of light from offshore.</p><p>他知道牠们要去哪儿，知道当整个一组再次游进水里时牠们要做什么，但他并不害怕。一想到即将发生的事情，他反而感到一种奇怪的饥饿。当这些东西敏捷地在漆黑的海水中向北起伏滑行，饥饿感迫使他去带头。牠们以令人难以置信的速度游着，但过了好几个小时，才在黑暗中隐约出现了一个，被近岸某个眩目灯光照亮的海岸。</p><p>Twilight deepened to true darkness over the water, but the offshore light burned brightly. It seemed to come from a huge wreck in the waves just off the coast, a great hulk floating on the waters like a crumpled beast. There were boats gathered around it, and floating flares of light that revealed the shore.</p><p>暮色渐浓，水面逐渐加深为真正的黑暗，但近岸的灯光却明亮地照耀着。它似乎是从海岸附近的波浪里一艘巨大的破船里发出的，一艘巨大的废船，像一头皱巴巴的野兽，浮在水面上。</p><p>As though by instinct, Dean, with the pack behind him, headed for the spot. Swiftly and silently they sped, their slimy heads blurred in the shadows to which they clung as they circled the boats and swam in towards the great crumpled shape. Now it was looming above him, and he could see arms flailing desperately as man after man sank below the surface. The colossal bulk from which they leaped was a wreck of twisted girders in which he could trace the warped outline of a vaguely familiar shape.</p><p>好像是出于本能，迪安带领着牠们朝那个地方游去。他们飞快地，悄无声息地前进，牠们粘糊糊的脑袋在阴影里显得模糊，牠们在船的四围转来绕去，朝那庞大而褶皱的东西游去。</p><p>And now, with curious disinterest, he swam lazily about, avoiding the lights bobbing over the water as he watched the actions of his companions. They were hunting their prey. Leering muzzles gaped for the drowning men, and lean talons raked bodies from the darkness. Whenever a man was glimpsed in the shadows not yet invaded by rescue boats, one of the sea-things craftily snared his victim.</p><p>现在，他带着奇怪的漠不关心，懒洋洋地游来游去，避开水面上闪烁的灯光，注视着同伴们的动作。他们在捕猎，为溺水之人倾斜着张开嘴，斜着爪子将躯体从黑暗中拖出。每当有人在尚未被救援船侵入的阴影中瞥见，就会有一个海兽狡猾地诱捕他的猎物。</p><p>In a little while they turned and slowly swam away. But now many of the creatures clutched a grisly trophy at their squamous breasts. The pale white limbs of drowning men trailed in the water as they were dragged off into the darkness by their captors. To the accompaniment of low, carrion laughter the beasts swam away, back down the coast.</p><p>过了一会儿，牠们转身慢慢地游走了。但现在，许多生物都在牠们鳞状的胸脯上抓着一个可怕的战利品。当溺水的人被俘获者拖进黑暗中时，其苍白的四肢在水中被拖在后面。伴随着低沉而腐朽的笑声，野兽们游回了海岸。</p><p>Dean swam with the rest. His mind was again a blur of confusion. He knew what the thing in the water was, and yet he could not name it. He had watched those hateful horrors snare doomed men and drag them off to the deep, yet he had not intervened. What was wrong? Even now, as he swam with frightening agility, he felt a call he could not fully understand—a call that his body was answering.</p><p>迪安同其余的一起游泳。他的脑中又是一片混乱，他知道水中之物为何，但却叫不出名字。他眼看着那些可恨的恐怖把不幸的人们拽进陷阱，将其拖入深渊，可他并不去干涉。是什么出了错？即使是现在，当他游得令人恐惧的灵活时，他仍然感到一个他不能完全理解的调用——一个他的身体正起反应的调用。</p><p>The hybrid things were gradually dispersing. With eerie splashings they disappeared below the surface of the gelid black waters, pulling with them the dreadfully limp bodies of the men, pulling them down to the blackness biding beneath.</p><p>混合的东西逐渐分散，伴随怪异的水花，消失在冰冷的黑水中。牠们拖着极度无力之人的身体，拖着他们下到黑暗中去。</p><p>They were hungry. Dean knew it without thinking. He swam on, along the coast, impelled by his curious urge. That was it—he was hungry.</p><p>牠们饿了。迪安不用思索便能知道。他在好奇心的驱使下，沿着海岸向前游去。仅此而已——他饿了。</p><p>And now he was going for food.</p><p>现在他要去找吃的了。</p><p>***</p><p>Hours of steady swimming southward. Then the familiar beach, and above it a lighted house which Dean recognized—his own house on the cliff. There were figures descending the slope now; two men with torches were coming down to the beach. He must not let them see him—why, he did not know, but they must not. He crawled along the beach, keeping close to the water’s edge. Even so, he seemed to move very swiftly.</p><p>数小时稳定地向南游去。然后是熟悉的海滩，上面是迪安认出的一幢点着灯的房子——他自己在悬崖上的那幢房子。现在有人影从斜坡上往下走，两个拿着火把的人正朝海滩走来。他不能让他们看见他——为什么，他不知道，但是他们绝对不能。他紧贴着水边，沿着海滩爬行。尽管如此，他的动作似乎还是很快。</p><p>The men with the torches were some distance behind him now. Ahead loomed another familiar outline—a cave. He had clambered over these rocks before, it seemed. He knew the pits of shadow that speckled the cliff rock, and knew the narrow passage of stone through which he now squeezed his prostrate body.</p><p>拿着火把的人现在离他还有一段距离。前面出现了另一个熟悉的轮廓——一个洞穴。他似乎以前曾爬过这些岩石。他知道悬崖岩石上的暗影坑，也知道他现在正从一条狭窄的石头通道里挤过去。</p><p>Was that someone shouting, far away?</p><p>远处有人在喊叫吗?</p><p>Darkness, and a lapping pool. He crawled forward, felt chill waters creep over his body. Muffled by distance came an insistent shouting from outside the cave.</p><p>黑暗，和一个搭接的水池。他向前爬去，感到凉水漫过他的身体。洞外传来一声响亮的喊叫，却因距离而含糊不清。</p><p>“Graham! Graham Dean!”</p><p>“格雷厄姆！格雷厄姆·迪安！”</p><p>Then the smell of dank sea-foulness was in his nostrils—a familiar, pleasant smell. He knew where he was, now. It was the cave where in his dream he had kissed the sea-thing. It was the cave in which—</p><p>然后他闻到了一股潮湿的海腐味——一种熟悉的、令人愉快的气味。他现在知道自己在哪儿了，这就是他在梦中吻过那只海兽的那个洞穴。那是个洞穴，位于——</p><p>He remembered now. The black blur lifted from his brain, and he remembered all. His mind bridged the gap, and he once again recalled coming here earlier this very evening, before he had found himself in the water.</p><p>他现在想起来了。他脑子里黑色的模糊消失了，他记起了一切。他的精神架起了桥梁，他再次回忆起，他发现自己在水里之前，今晚的早些时候曾来过这里。</p><p>Morelia Godolfo had called him here; here her dark whispers had guided him at twilight, when he had come from the bed at Doctor Yamada’s house. It was the siren song of the sea-creature that had lured him in dreams.</p><p>莫雷利娅·戈道尔夫把他呼唤到这里，黄昏时分，当他从山田医生家的床上爬起来之时，她黑暗的低语引领着他。是海洋生物的塞壬之歌把在梦中引诱着他。</p><p>He remembered how she had coiled about his feet when he entered, flung her sea-bleached body up until its inhuman head had loomed close to his own. And then the hot pulpy lips had pressed against his—the loathsome, slimy lips had kissed him again. Wet, dank, horribly avid kiss! His senses had drowned in its evil, for he knew that this second kiss meant doom.</p><p>他还记得当他进来时她是怎样缠住他的脚的，把她那被海水漂白了的身体向上盘绕，直到它那非人的脑袋逼近他的头为止。然后那火辣的浆状嘴唇贴着他的嘴唇——那讨厌的、黏滑的嘴唇又吻了他一下。潮湿且可怕地热情的吻！他的理智被其邪恶淹没了，因为他知道这第二次接吻意味着厄运。</p><p>“The sea-dweller will take your body,” Doctor Yamada had said —and the second kiss meant doom.</p><p>“海洋住民会获得你的身体。”山田医生说过——第二次吻意味着厄运。</p><p>All this had happened hours ago!</p><p>这一切几小时前就已发生!</p><p>Dean shifted around in the rocky chamber to avoid wetting himself in the pool. As he did so, he glanced down at his body for the first time that night—glanced down with an undulating neck at the shape he had worn for three hours in the sea. He saw the fish-like scales, the scabrous whiteness of the slimy skin; saw the veined gills. He stared into the waters of the pool then, so that the reflection of his face was visible in the dim moonlight that filtered through fissures in the rocks.</p><p>迪安在岩穴中移来移去，以免水池弄湿了自己。这么做的时候，那天晚上，他头一次低头看了一眼自己的身体——他用那起伏的脖子俯视着他在海里三个小时以来的样子。他看到了像鱼一样的鳞片，看到了黏滑皮肤那猥亵的雪白，看到了布满血管的鳃。他凝视着池子里的水，在透过岩石缝隙的朦胧月光下，可以看到他的脸的倒影。</p><p>He saw all—</p><p>他看见了一切——</p><p>His head rested on the long, reptilian neck. It was an anthropoid head with flat contours that were monstrously inhuman. The eyes were white and protuberant; they bulged with the glassy stare of a drowning thing. There was no nose, and the center of the face was covered with a tangle of wormy blue feelers. The mouth was the worst of all. Dean saw pale white lips in a dead face—human lips. Lips that had kissed his own. And now—they were his own!</p><p>他的头长爬行动物般的长脖子上。这是一个有着扁平轮廓的类人脑袋，非人得荒唐。眼睛是白而突出的，它们像落水的东西一样呆滞地瞪着。没有鼻子，脸的中央覆盖着一团缠在一起的蓝色触须。嘴巴是其中最为糟糕的。迪安在一张呆板的脸上看到了苍白的嘴唇——人的嘴唇。吻过他自己的双唇。现在——它们是属于他自己的了!</p><p>He was in the body of the evil sea-thing—the evil sea-thing that had once harbored the soul of Morelia Godolfo!</p><p>他在邪恶的海兽体内——那个曾经寄宿着莫雷利亚·戈道尔夫灵魂的邪恶海兽！</p><p>At that moment Dean would gladly have welcomed death, for the stark, blasphemous horror of his discovery was too much to bear. He knew about his dreams now, and the legends; he had learned the truth, and paid a hideous price. He recalled, vividly, how he had recovered consciousness in the water and swum out to meet those—others. He recalled the great black hulk from which drowning men had been taken in boats—the shattered wreck on the water. What was it Yamada had told him? “When there is a wreck they go there, like vultures to a feast.” And now, at last, he remembered what had eluded him that night—what that familiar shape on the waters had been. It was a crashed zeppelin. He had gone swimming into the wreckage with those things, and they had taken men—. Three hours—God! Dean wanted very much to die. He was in the sea body of Morelia Godolfo, and it was too evil for further life.</p><p>在那一刻，迪安会欣然接受死亡，因为他的发现所带来的赤裸裸的，亵渎的恐怖实在令人无法忍受。他现在记起了他的梦和那些传说。他了解了真相，并为此付出了可怕的代价。他历历在目地回想，他是如何在水中恢复知觉，然后游出去和其他存在见面的。他回想起那艘巨大的黑船，船上的溺水者都是从那被带走的——那是水面上破碎的残骸。山田告诉过他的是什么？</p><p>“当有船只失事时，他们就像秃鹫赴宴一样去那里。”</p><p>现在，他终于记起了那晚他无法到达的东西——水面上那个熟悉的形状是什么?是一艘坠毁的齐柏林硬式飞艇。他带着那些东西游到残骸里去了，牠们带走了人类——三个小时——上帝啊！迪安非常想去死。他在莫里利亚·戈道尔夫的海之躯体，之后的生命实在是太邪恶了。</p><p>Morelia Godolfo! Where was she? And his own body, the shape of Graham Dean?</p><p>莫雷利娅·戈道尔夫！她在哪里？格雷厄姆·迪安的模样，他自己的身体呢？</p><p>***</p><p>A rustling in the shadowy cavern behind him proclaimed the answer. Graham Dean saw himself in the moonlight—saw his body, line for line, hunching furtively past the pool in an attempt to creep away unobserved.</p><p>他身后阴暗的洞穴里传来一阵沙沙声，宣布了答案。格雷厄姆·迪安在月光中看见了他自己——看见他自己身体清晰的轮廓，正弓着背偷偷穿过池塘，企图趁其不注意悄悄溜走。</p><p>Dean’s flippered fins moved swiftly. His own body turned.</p><p>迪安的鳍移动得很快，他自己的身体转过身来。</p><p>It was ghastly for Dean to see himself reflected where no mirror existed; ghastlier still to see that in his face there no longer were his eyes. The sly, mocking stare of the sea-creature peered out at him from behind their fleshy mask, and they were ancient, evil. The pseudo-human snarled at him and tried to dodge off into the darkness. Dean followed, on all fours.</p><p>迪安在没有镜子的地方看到自己的倒影，这是可怕的。更可怕的是，他脸上的眼睛不再是他的。这个海洋生物从牠们肉质面具背后嘲弄的狡黠目光窥视着他，牠们是古老的，邪恶的。那个伪人向他咆哮着，试图躲到黑暗中去。迪安四肢着地跟在后面。</p><p>He knew what he must do. That sea-thing—Morelia—she had taken his body during that last black kiss, just as he had been forced into hers, but she had not yet recovered enough to go out into the world. That was why he had found her still in the cave. Now, however, she would leave, and his uncle Michael would never know. The world would never know, either, what horror stalked its surface—until it was too late. Dean, his own tragic form hateful to him now, knew what he must do.</p><p>他知道他必须要做什么。那个海兽——莫雷利娅——在那最后一次的邪恶之吻中，她把他的身体夺去了，就像他被强行拽进她的身体一样，但是她还没有完全恢复过来，还不能去外面的世界。所以他才发现她还在洞里。然而，现在她要走了，他的叔叔迈克尔永远也不会知道。世界也永远不会知道，到底是什么恐怖在地表蔓延着，直到为时已晚。迪安现在痛恨他自己悲剧的形式，他知道他必须要做什么。</p><p>Purposefully he maneuvered the mocking body of himself into a rocky corner. There was a look of fright in those gelid eyes—</p><p>他有意地把自己嘲讽的身体挪到一个岩石的角落里。那双冰冷的眼中有一种惊骇的神色——</p><p>A sound caused Dean to turn, pivoting his reptilian neck. Through glazed fish-eyes he saw the faces of Michael Leigh and Doctor Yamada. Torches in hand, they were entering the cave.</p><p>一个声音使迪安转过身来，转动着他那爬行动物般的脖子。透过呆滞的鱼眼，他看到了迈克尔·利和山田医生的面孔。他们手里拿着火把，正在进入洞穴。</p><p>Dean knew what they would do, and he no longer cared. He closed in on the human body that housed the soul of the sea-beast; closed in with the beast’s own flailing flippers; seized it in its own arms and menaced it with its own teeth near the creature’s white, human neck.</p><p>迪安知道他们会做什么，他也不在乎了。他靠近那个藏着海兽灵魂之人的躯体，用野兽自己甩动的脚蹼把自己包围起来;用他自己的胳膊抓住牠，用自己的牙齿在牠白色的人类脖子附近威胁着牠。</p><p>From behind him he heard shouts and cries at his very back, but Dean did not care. He had a duty to perform, an atonement. Through the corner of his eye, he saw the barrel of a revolver as it glinted in Yamada's hand.</p><p>他听见背后有人在喊叫，但迪安并不在意。他有一种责任要履行，那就是赎罪。透过眼角，他看到左轮手枪的枪管在山田手中闪烁。</p><p>Then came two bursts of stabbing flame and the oblivion Dean craved. But he died happy, for he had atoned for the black kiss.</p><p>接着是两束刺目火光的脉冲，迪安渴望着忘却。但是他死得很高兴，因为他回报了那个邪恶之吻。</p><p>Even as he sank into death, Graham Dean had bitten with animal fangs into his own throat, and his heart was filled with peace as, dying, he saw himself die—</p><p>就在他陷入死亡的时候，格雷厄姆·迪安用动物的毒牙咬进自己的喉咙，他心里充满了平静，因为他眼看着自己就要死了——</p><p>His soul mingled in the third black kiss of Death.</p><p>他的灵魂在死亡的第三次邪恶之吻中换了回去。</p><p>——————</p><p>塞勒姆恐怖的简介</p><p>It is clear that Lovecraft recognized Kuttner1s tale as a rehash of his own “The Dreams in the Witch House”, but he didn’t seem to mind, any more than he ever acknowledged the dependence of Mearle Prout’s “The House of the Worm” on his own “The Call of Cthulhu. ”</p><p>很明显洛夫克拉夫特认出了库特纳的故事是他自己的《魔女屋中之梦》的翻版，但他似乎并不介意，就像他不承认米尔勒·普劳特(Mearle Prout)的《蠕虫之屋》(The House of the Worm)依附于他自己的《克苏鲁的呼唤》一样。"</p><p>Though Lovecraft pointed out the anachronisms in Kuttner’s descriptions of Salem (Kuttner dutifully corrected them), he let another go without comment: in his Necronomicon passage Kuttner has Abdul Alhazred make a passing reference to the Great Khan of the Mongols—who lived several centuries after Abdul Alhazred! (In my Critical Commentary on the Necronomicon I resort to the expedient of excising the whole passage as a later interpolation into the text of Alhazred.)</p><p>尽管洛夫克拉夫特指出了库特纳对塞勒姆的描述中的时代错误(库特纳忠实地修正了它们)，但他没有发表任何评论：在他的《死灵之书》里，库特纳让阿卜杜勒·阿尔哈兹莱德顺便提到了蒙古的大可汗——他生活在阿卜杜勒·阿尔哈兹雷德之后的几个世纪！(在我的《对死灵之书的评注》[Critical Commentary on the Necronomicon]中，我采取了删除整篇文章的权宜之计，作为后来插入到阿尔哈兹莱德的文本的补充。)</p><p>First publication: Weird Tales, May 1937.</p><p>首次出版：《诡丽幻谭》1937年5月</p></body></html>
