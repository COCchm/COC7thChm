Lovecraft mentions the uncanny canines in "The Whisperer in Darkness", and later the Hounds were taken out fora walk by both Brian Lumley and Roger Zelazny. The device of the drug that enables the user to swim backward in the time stream also proved influential. One finds it in this story by Kuttner as well. We will find something similar again in "Hydra."</p><p>弗兰克·比尔纳普·朗的《廷达洛斯猎犬》被证实是很有影响力的。洛夫克拉夫特在《暗夜低语者》中提到了神秘的犬科动物，之后猎犬们被布莱恩·拉姆利和罗杰·泽拉兹尼拉出去溜溜。能让使用者在时间之溪中回游之药物的设计同样被证实是有影响力的。在库特纳的这个故事中也被可以找到。我们会在《海德拉》中再次发现类似的东西。</p><p>Kuttner also has a good bit of fun with his friend Bloch's Mysteries of the Worm in this story. He notes that "the book's kept in a vault in the Huntington Library... but I managed to get photostatic copies of the pages I needed... Scarcely anyone in California knows that such a book exists in the Huntington Library." Of course, there is no De Vermis Mysteriis there or any place else, but Kuttner1 s fiction did prove to be strangely prophetic. As it happens, the Huntington Library did acquire a treasure trove of ancient esoteric manuscripts—a complete set of photograph copies of the Dead Sea Scrolls—and few knew of their presence. Though a good three-fourths of the Scroll texts had been published by the 1960's and '70's, the official authorities in Jerusalem kept the remainder under wraps. All scholarly requests for access and plans to publish these texts were quashed by the authorities.</p><p>在这篇故事中，库特纳也对他的朋友布洛克的《蠕虫的秘密》有相当多的兴致。他指出“这本书保存在亨廷顿图书馆的地下室里……但我设法搞到了我需要之页数的影印本……在加利福尼亚，几乎没有人知道亨廷顿图书馆中有着这样的一本书。”当然，没有任何一个地方有真正的《蠕虫的秘密》，但库特纳的小说确实被证明是具有奇怪的预见性。碰巧，亨廷顿图书馆获得了一个古代深奥之手稿的珍藏品——一套完整的死海古卷照片摹本——很少有人知道它们的存在。虽然四分之三的卷轴文本在六七十年代已经出版，但耶路撒冷的官方机构对其余部分秘而不宣。所有的学术访问请求和出版这些文本的计划都被当局取消了。</p><p>To break this scholarly monopoly, the Huntington Library announced in 1991 that any interested scholar might have access to their set of copies. Since then we have witnessed a firestorm of controversy over the Scrolls, their content, date, authorship, and possible repercussions for the early history of Christianity. Kuttner was more than half right in depicting a secret manuscript kept under wraps at the Huntington Library, as well as the furor that resulted when photocopies were made available!</p><p>为了打破这种学术垄断，亨廷顿图书馆在1991年宣布，任何感兴趣的学者都可有权访问他们那套摹本。从那时起，我们见证了一场涵盖古卷内容，年代，作者以及对早期基督教历史可能产生之影响的激烈争论。库特纳对在亨廷顿图书馆保密下之手稿的描述有一半是对的，还有影印本之出现所引起的公众骚动！</p><p>First publication: Strange Stories, February 1939</p><p>首次出版：《怪奇故事》(Strange Stories)，1939年2月</p><p>***</p><p>"Oh—it's you,"said Hayward. "You got my wire?"</p><p>“噢——是你，”海沃德说。“你收到我的电报了吗？”</p><p>The light from the doorway of the cottage outlined his tall, lean figure, making his shadow a long, black blotch on the narrow bar of radiance that shone across the sand to where green-black rollers were surging.</p><p>小屋门口的灯光勾勒出他那高大瘦削的身影，使他的影子在那传过沙地，直照到汹涌澎湃的黑绿滚轴的狭窄光带上呈出一条长长的黑疙瘩。</p><p>A sea bird gave a shrill, eerie cry from the darkness, and I saw Hayward's silhouette give a curious little jerk.</p><p>一只海鸟在黑暗中发出一声尖锐可怕的叫喊，我看见海沃德的剪影古怪地略微抽搐了下。</p><p>"Come in," he said, quickly, stepping back.</p><p>Mason and I followed him into the cottage.</p><p>“进来吧，”他说得很快，往后退去。梅森与我跟着他进了小屋。</p><p>Michael Hayward was a writer—a unique one. Very few writers could create the strange atmosphere of eldritch horror that Hayward put into his fantastic tales of mystery. He had imitators—all great writers have—but none attained the stark and dreadful illusion of reality with which he invested his oftentimes shocking fantasies. He went far beyond the bounds of human experience and familiar superstition, delving into uncanny fields of unearthliness. Blackwood's vampiric elementals, M. R. James' loathsome liches—even the black horror of de Maupassant's "Horla" and Bierce's "Damned Thing"—paled by comparison.</p><p>迈克尔·海沃德(Michael Hayward)是一位作家——一位独特的作家。很少有作家能像海沃德在他那荒诞离奇的神秘故事中所表现的那样，营造出一种诡异的，可怕恐怖的气氛。他有模仿者——所有伟大的作家都有——但没有一人能到达他那些频频震惊众人的，用质朴而可怕之真实幻景加以渲染的想象。他远超于人类经验和熟悉的迷信之范畴，深入神秘的怪异领域。布莱克伍德的吸血鬼元素，M.R.詹姆斯那令人憎恶的尸体——甚至莫泊桑《奥尔拉》的黑色恐怖和比尔斯的《该死的怪物》——都相形见绌。</p><p>It wasn't the abnormal beings Hayward wrote about so much as the masterly impression of reality he managed to create in the reader's mind—the ghastly idea that he wasn't writing fiction, but was simply transcribing on paper the stark, hellish truth. It was no wonder that the jaded public avidly welcomed each new story he wrote.</p><p>海沃德所写的大多并非反常的存在，而是娴熟地描写了许多他设法在读者头脑中创造出来的对现实的印象——那种可怕的想法，即他并非在写小说，而仅仅是在纸上抄录地狱般赤裸裸的真相。难怪厌倦的公众会热情地欢迎他所写的每一篇新故事。</p><p>Bill Mason had telephoned me that afternoon at the Journal, where I worked, and had read me an urgent telegram from Hayward asking -in fact, begging- us to come at once to his isolated cottage on the beach north of Santa Barbara. Now, beholding him, I wondered at the urgency.</p><p>比尔·梅森(Bill Mason)在我于《华尔街日报》(the Journal)工作的那天下午给我打了电话，并对我念了一封海沃德发来的紧急电报，请求——实际上，是恳求——我们立刻前往他在圣巴巴拉(Santa Barbara)北部海滨的那座孤零零的别墅去。现在，我注视着他，对这种紧迫性感到费解。</p><p>He didn't seem ill, although his thin face was more gaunt than usual, and his eyes unnaturally bright. There was a nervous tension in his manner, and I got the odd impression that he was intently listening, alert for some sound from outside the cottage. As he took our coats and motioned us to chairs, Mason gave me a worried glance.</p><p>他并不像是生病了，尽管他那瘦削的脸比平时更憔悴，他的眼睛异常明亮。他的神情有些紧张，我奇怪地感觉到，他正聚精会神地听着，注意着屋外的动静。当他取下我们的外套，示意我们坐到椅子上时，梅森忧虑地看了我一眼。</p><p>Something was wrong. Mason sensed it, I sensed it. Hayward filled his pipe and lit it, the smoke wreathing about his stiff black hair. There were bluish shadows in his temples.</p><p>有什么东西不对劲。梅森感觉到了，我也感觉到了。海沃德填上他的烟斗，点上火，烟在他那坚硬的黑发上缭绕着。</p><p>"What's up, old man?" I hazarded. "We couldn't make head nor tail of your wire."</p><p>“怎么了，老头子？”我冒昧地开口。“我们看不懂你的电报。”</p><p>He flushed. "I guess I was a little flurried when I wrote it. You see, Gene—oh, what's the use—something is wrong, very wrong. At first I thought it might be my nerves, but—it isn't."</p><p>他脸红了。“我想我写它的时候有点慌乱。你看，吉恩(Gene)——哦，那又有什么用呢——有什么东西不对劲，非常不对劲。起先我以为是我的神经出了问题，可——并不是。”</p><p>From outside the cottage came the shrill cry of a gull, and Hayward turned his face to the window. His eyes were staring, and I saw him repress a shudder. Then he seemed to pull himself together. He faced us, his lips compressed.</p><p>屋外传来了海鸥刺耳的叫声，海沃德将脸转向窗外，瞪着眼睛。我看到他忍住了战栗，然后似乎振作了起来，面对着我们，双唇紧闭。</p><p>"Tell me, Gene—and you, Bill—did you notice anything— odd—on your way up?"</p><p>“告诉我，吉恩——还有你，比尔——在你们来的路上有没有注意到什么——奇怪的东西？”</p><p>"Why, no," I said.</p><p>“为什么，没有，”我说。</p><p>"Nothing? Are you sure? It might have seemed unimportant— any sounds, I mean."</p><p>“没有什么？你确定吗？它可能看起来不重要——我的意思是，任何声音。”</p><p>"There were the seagulls," Mason said, frowning. "You remember, I mentioned them to you, Gene."</p><p>“有海鸥，”梅森说，皱着眉头。“你记得吗，吉恩，我跟你提过的。”</p><p>Hayward caught him up sharply. "Seagulls?"</p><p>海沃德猛地接上他的话。“海鸥？”</p><p>"Yes," I said. "That is, birds of some kind—they didn't sound quite like seagulls. We couldn't see them, but they kept following the car, calling to each other. We could hear them. But aside from the birds—"</p><p>“是的，”我说。“也就是说，某种鸟——牠们的声音听起来不太像是海鸥。我们看不见牠们，但牠们一直跟在车子后面，互相叫喊着。我们能听到牠们。但除了鸟以外——”</p><p>I hesitated, astonished at the look on Hayward's face—an expression almost of despair. He said, "No—that's it, Gene. But they weren't birds. They're something—you won't believe," he whispered, and there was fright in his eyes. "Not till you see them—and then it'll be too late."</p><p>我犹豫了一下，海沃德脸上的表情使我大吃一惊——一种近乎绝望的表情。他说：“不——就是这样，吉恩。但牠们不是鸟。那是一些——你不会相信的东西。”他喃喃低语，他眼睛里充满了恐惧。“直到你见到牠们，然后那就太晚了。”</p><p>"Mike," I said. "You've been overworking. You've—"</p><p>“迈克，”我说，“你一直在超负荷工作。你已经——”</p><p>"No," he interrupted. "I'm not losing my grip. Those weird stories of mine—they haven't driven me mad, if that's what you're thinking. I'm as sane as you are. The truth is," he said very slowly, choosing his words with care, "I am being attacked."</p><p>“不，”他打断我。“我没有失去控制。我的那些怪奇故事——牠们并没有把我逼疯，如果你是这么想的话。我和你一样理智。事实是,“他说得很慢，谨慎地措词，“我正被攻击。”</p><p>I groaned inwardly. Delusions of persecution—a symptom of insanity. Was Hayward's mind really crumbling? Why, I wondered, were his eyes so unnaturally bright, and his thin face so flushed? And why did he keep shooting quick, furtive glances at the window?</p><p>我暗自叹息。被害的妄想——精神病的症状。海沃德的理智真的崩溃了吗？我纳闷，为什么他的眼睛是那么的异常明亮，为什么他那瘦脸是那么的红？并且为什么他总是快速地偷瞥向窗户？</p><p>I turned to the window. I started to say something and stopped.</p><p>我转向窗户。我刚想说什么，又停住了。</p><p>I was looking at a vine. That is, it resembled a thick, fleshy vine more than anything else, but I had never seen any plant quite similar to the rope-like thing that lay along the window ledge. I opened the window to get a better look at it.</p><p>我在看一根藤蔓。换句话说，它像是一根又粗又丰满的藤蔓，但我从来没有见过任何植物像那沿着窗台躺着的绳子一样的东西。我打开窗户以便看得更清楚些。</p><p>It was as thick as my forearm, and very pale—yellowish ivory. It possessed a curious glossy texture that made it seem semi-transparent, and it ended in a raw-looking stump that was overgrown with stiff, hair-like cilia. The tip somehow made me think of an elephant's trunk, although there was no real similarity. The other end dangled from the window ledge and disappeared in the darkness toward the front of the house. And, somehow, I didn't like the look of the thing.</p><p>它是个跟我的前臂一样粗，并且是非常淡的米白色。它有一种奇怪的光滑质地，让它看起来像是半透明的，它的一端看起来像是被擦掉皮的树桩，其上长满稠密毛发状的纤毛。尽管没有真正的相似之处，但这个尖端莫名其妙地令我想起了大象的鼻子。另一端从窗台上垂下去，消失在朝着房子前面的黑暗中。不知怎的，我不喜欢它的模样。</p><p>"What is it?" Mason asked behind me.</p><p>“这是什么？”梅森在我背后问道。</p><p>I picked up the—the—whatever it was. Then I got a severe shock, for it began to slip through my hand! It was being pulled away from me, and as I stared the end slipped through my fingers and whipped into the darkness. I craned out the window.</p><p>我拿起了——了——不管它是什么。然后我受到了剧烈的惊吓，因为它开始滑过我的手！它正脱离我，当我盯着它看的时候，它从我的手指间滑过，迅速消失在黑暗中。我探出窗外。</p><p>"There's somebody outside!" I flung over my shoulder. "I saw—"</p><p>“有人在外面！”我甩甩肩膀。“我看见——”</p><p>I felt a hand seize me, shove me aside. "Shut that window," Hayward gasped. He slammed it down, locked it. And I heard a gasping inarticulate cry from Mason.</p><p>我感觉到有一只手拽住了我，把我拉到一旁。“关上那扇窗，”海沃德喘着气。他砰的一声关上它，锁住它。并且我听到梅森喘气着含糊地叫了一声。</p><p>He was standing in the open doorway, glaring out. His face was changing, becoming transfigured with amazement and loathing.</p><p>他站在敞开的门口，向外瞪视，其面容因惊奇与嫌恶而变了形。</p><p>From outside the portal came a shrill, mewing cry—and a blast of great winds. Sand swirled in through the doorway. I saw Mason stagger back, his arm flung up before his eyes.</p><p>从门外传来一声刺耳的海鸥叫——并一阵狂风的呼号。沙粒旋过门口。我看见梅森将胳膊举在其眼前，蹒跚着后退。</p><p>Hayward leaped for the door, slammed it. I helped the now shuddering Mason to a chair. It was terrible to see this usually imperturbable man in the grip of what could only be called panic. He dropped into the seat, glaring up at me with distended eyes. I gave him my flask; his fingers were white as they gripped it. He took a hasty gulp. His breathing was rapid and uneven.</p><p>海沃德扑向门，砰地关上了它。我扶着正发着颤的梅森往椅子走去。看到这个在平日里沉着冷静的人陷入只能被称作惊恐的状态之中，真是可怕。他跌坐在座位里，用鼓胀的眼睛瞪着我。我把酒瓶递给他，他抓着瓶子，手指发白。他匆匆吞咽了口，其呼吸急促而不均匀。</p><p>Hayward came up beside me, stood looking down at Mason, pity in his face.</p><p>海沃德来到我身旁，站在那儿低头望着梅森，脸上流露着怜悯。</p><p>"What the devil's the matter?" I cried. But Mason ignored me, had eyes only for Hayward.</p><p>“究竟是怎么回事?”我喊道。但梅森无视了我，直望着海沃德。</p><p>"G-God in heaven," he whispered. "Have I—gone mad, Hayward?"</p><p>“老，老天啊，”他喃喃低语。“海沃德，我是不是疯了？”</p><p>Hayward shook his head slowly. "I've seen them, too."</p><p>海沃德缓缓地摇摇头。“我也见过牠们。”</p><p>"Bill," I said sharply. "What's out there? What did you see?"</p><p>“比尔，”我急促地说。“什么在外面？你看到了什么？”</p><p>He only shook his head violently, trying to repress the violent paroxysms of trembling that were shaking him.</p><p>他只是拼命地摇头，竭力抑制着自己剧烈的颤抖。</p><p>I swung about, went to the door, opened it. I don't know what I expected to see—some animal, perhaps—a mountain lion or even a huge snake of some kind. But there was nothing there—just the empty white beach.</p><p>我转过身，走到门口，把它打开。我不知道我期望看见什么——一些动物，或许吧——一只美洲狮，甚至是一条巨蛇，诸如此类的东西。但什么也没有——仅是空荡荡的白沙滩。</p><p>It was true there was a disk-shaped area of disturbed sand nearby, but I could make nothing of that. I heard Hayward shouting at me to close the door.</p><p>附近确实有一片圆盘状的，被扰动的沙地，但我对此一无所知。我听见海沃德大声叫我把门关上。</p><p>I shut it. "There's nothing there," I said.</p><p>我关上了它。“什么也没有，”我说。</p><p>"It—must have gone," Mason managed to get out. "Give me another drink, will you?"</p><p>“牠——肯定走了，”梅森设法说出话来。“再给我来一杯，好吗？”</p><p>I handed him my flask. Hayward was fumbling in his desk. "Look here," he said after a moment, coming back with a scrap of yellow paper. He thrust it at Mason, and Bill gasped out something incoherent. "That's it," he said, getting his voice under control. "That's the—the thing I saw!"</p><p>我把酒瓶递给他。海沃德在其书桌中摸索着。“看这儿，”过了会儿，他拿着一张破碎黄纸回来了。他把它塞给梅森，比尔喘着粗气，语无伦次地说着。</p><p>“那就是,”他控制着嗓音，说。“就是我看到的——的东西！”</p><p>I peered over his shoulder, scrutinizing the paper. It bore a sketch in pencil, of something that looked as if it had emerged from a naturalist's nightmare. At first glance I got the impression of a globe, oddly flattened at the top and bottom, and covered with what I thought at first was a sparse growth of very long and thick hairs. Then I saw that they were appendages, slender tentacles. On the rugose upper surface of the thing was a great faceted eye, and below this a puckered orifice that corresponded, perhaps, to a mouth. Sketched hastily by Hayward, who was not an artist, it was nevertheless powerfully evocative of the hideous.</p><p>我越过他的肩膀，仔细审视着那张纸。上面呈现出一幅铅笔速写，像是出现在一位自然学家之噩梦中的产物。那东西我第一眼看上去像是个球体，顶部和底部出奇地平坦，上面覆盖着我起先认为的，稀疏生长的，很长很粗的毛发。然后我看到它们其实是附属的，细长的触须。在那东西皱褶的表面上，有一只巨大的多面眼睛，其下有个起皱的孔洞，也许是一张嘴。这是海沃德匆忙的速写，他虽然不是位艺术家，但并不妨碍它强烈地唤起了人们对可怕的回忆。</p><p>"That's the thing," Mason said. "Put it away! It was all—shining, though. And it made that—that sound."</p><p>“就是那东西，”梅森说。“把它拿走！尽管如此，一切都在——闪闪发光。而且它发出了那——那种声音。”</p><p>"Where did it go?" Hayward asked.</p><p>“牠去向哪里了？”海沃德问道。</p><p>"I—don't know. It didn't roll away—or go into the ocean. I'm sure of that. All I heard was that blast of wind, and sand blew in my eyes. Then—well, it was gone."</p><p>“我——不知道。牠没有滚走——也没有下到海里，我对此是肯定的。我只听到一阵风声，沙子吹进我的眼睛。然后——好吧，牠不见了。”</p><p>***</p><p>I shivered.</p><p>我不尽打了个哆嗦。</p><p>"It's cold," Hayward said, watching me. "It always gets cold when they come." Silently he began to kindle a fire in the stone fireplace.</p><p>“天气真冷，”海沃德望着我，说。“牠们来的时候，总是很冷。”他静静地开始在石头壁炉里生火。</p><p>"But such things can't exist!" Mason cried out in sudden protest. Then in tones of despair: "But I saw it, I saw it!"</p><p>“但那样的东西不可能存在！”梅森突然抗议地叫喊着，然后用绝望的语气说：“但我看见牠了，我看见牠了！”</p><p>"Get hold of yourself, Bill," I snapped.</p><p>“比尔，控制好你自己，”我呵斥着。</p><p>"I don't give a damn what you think, Gene," he cried. "I saw something out there that—why, I've always laughed at such things—legends, dreams—but, God! when one sees it—oh, I'm not trying to fool you, Gene. You'll probably see the thing yourself before long." He finished with a curious note of horror in his voice.</p><p>“吉恩，我一点也不在乎你怎么想，”他叫喊着。“我看到外面的某些东西——为什么，我总是嘲笑这样的东西——传说，幻梦——但是，上帝啊！当一看到牠——哦，吉恩，我不是想愚弄你，你可能不久之后就能亲眼看到了那东西了。”他以一种古怪的，带着恐惧的声调结束了他的话。</p><p>I knew he wasn't lying. Still—"Are you sure it wasn't a—a mirage?" I asked. "The spray, perhaps—an optical illusion?"</p><p>我知道他没有说谎。但还——“你确定那不是一个——一个海市蜃楼？”我问道。“浪花，或许——一种光学错觉？”</p><p>Hayward broke in. "No, Gene." He faced us, grim lines bracketing his mouth. "It's no illusion. It's the stark, hideous truth. Even now I sometimes try to make myself believe I'm dreaming some fantastic, incredible nightmare from which I'll eventually awaken. But no. I—I couldn't stand it any longer— alone. The things have been here for two days now. There are several of them—five or six, perhaps more. That's why I sent you the wire."</p><p>海沃德插了进来。“不，吉恩。”他面对我们，他的嘴上布满了可怕的皱纹。“这不是幻觉，这是赤裸裸的，可怕的事实。即便是现在，我有时仍然试着让自己相信是我做着了一些不可思议的噩梦，我最终会从中醒来。但是不。我——我再也无法——独自地——忍受了。那东西已经在这里两天了。牠们有好几个——五个或六个，或许更多。这就是我给你们发电报的原因。”</p><p>"Five or six of what?" I demanded, but Mason interrupted me quickly.</p><p>“五个或六个什么？”我逼问着，但梅森很快打断了我。</p><p>"Can't we get out? My car is down the road a bit."</p><p>“我们不能出去吗?”我的车子在路的尽头。”</p><p>"Don't you think I've tried?" Hayward cried. "I'm afraid to. I've my car too. As a matter of fact, I did start for Santa Barbara last night. I thought I might get away under cover of dark. But the noises—those sounds they make—got louder and louder, and I had the feeling, somehow, that they were getting ready to drop on me. I flagged a man and paid him to send you the wire."</p><p>“你不认为我已经试过了吗？”海沃德喊道。“我害怕。我也有我的车。事实上，我昨晚确实去了圣巴巴拉。我想我或许能在夜幕的掩护下逃走。但噪声——牠们制造的那些声音——编的越来越响，我有一种感觉，不知何故，他们正准备来找我。我招呼了一个人，给他付了钱，让他给你们发电报。”</p><p>"But what are they?" Mason burst out. "Have you no idea? Such things don't just appear. Some hybrid form of life from the sea, perhaps—some unknown form of life—"</p><p>“但牠们是什么？”梅森大声叫着。“你不知道吗?这样的东西不会凭空出现。某种来自海洋的混合形态的生命，或许——某种未知的生命形式——”</p><p>Hayward nodded. "Exactly. An unknown form of life. But one totally alien, foreign to mankind. Not from the sea, Bill, not from the sea. From another dimension—another plane of existence."</p><p>海沃德点点头。“无错。一种未知的生命形式。而是全然的异种，对人类而言是陌生的。不是从海里来的，比尔，不是从海里来的。来自另一个维度——另一个存在的位面。”</p><p>This was too much for me. "Oh, come, Hayward," I said. "You can't really mean—why, it's against all logic."</p><p>这对我而言太难了。“哦，来吧，海沃德，”我说。“你不会真这么想吧——为什么，这不合逻辑。”</p><p>"You didn't see it," Mason said, glaring at me. "If you'd seen that frightful, obscene thing, as I did—"</p><p>“你没有看见牠，”梅森瞪着我说。“如果你也像我一样看到了那种可怖又可憎的东西——”</p><p>"Look here," cut in Hayward abruptly. "I—I shouldn't have brought you into this. Seeing what it's done to Bill has made me realize—you're still free to go, you know. Perhaps it would be better—"</p><p>“看这里，”海沃德突然插了进来。"我——我不该把你们扯进来的。看到牠对比尔所做的这一切让我意识到——你还是可以走的，你知道的。也许这样更好——”</p><p>I shook my head. I wasn't going to run from a cry in the night, an odd-looking vine, an optical illusion. Besides, I knew what an effort it had cost Hayward to get out those words of renunciation. But before I could speak, a strange, shrill cry came from outside the house. Hayward glanced quickly at the window. He had pulled the shade down.</p><p>我摇了摇我的头。我不会逃避夜晚的叫声，一根奇形怪状的藤蔓，一种光学错觉。再说，我也知道海沃德为了把这番放弃的话说出来，耗费了多大的努力。但我还没来得及说话，一声奇怪的尖叫声从屋外传来。海沃德飞快地瞥了一眼窗外，他把窗帘拉了下来。</p><p>His face was grave. "I've changed my mind," he said. "You mustn't leave the house tonight. Tomorrow, perhaps—''</p><p>他神情严肃。“我改变主意了，”他说。“你今夜不能离开这幢房子。明天，可能——”</p><p>He turned to his desk, picked up a small pillbox. Mutely he extended his hand, on which he had dropped a few round, blackish pellets.</p><p>他转向书桌，拿起一个小药盒。他无言地伸出手，手中放着几粒又圆又黑的小球。</p><p>I picked one up, sniffed at it curiously. I felt an odd tickling sensation in my nostrils, and suddenly, for no apparent reason, thought of a childhood incident long buried in the past—nothing important, merely a clandestine visit to an apple orchard with two youthful chums. We had filled two gunny sacks—</p><p>我拿起一粒，好奇地闻了闻，感觉到鼻孔中有一种奇怪的瘙痒。突然地，没来由地，埋葬于过去的童年往事涌上心头——没什么重要的事，只是和两个年轻的好朋友悄悄去了趟苹果林。我们装满了两个麻袋——</p><p>Why should I remember this now? I had entirely forgotten that boyhood adventure—at least, I hadn't thought of it in years.</p><p>为什么我现在竟然想起这些？我已全然忘却少年时代的冒险经历——至少，我已多年没去想过这件事了。</p><p>Hayward took the pellet from me rather hastily, watching my face. "That was the beginning," he said after a pause. "It's a drug. Yes," he went on at our startled expressions. "I've been taking it. Oh, it's not hashish or opium—I wish it were! It's far worse—I got the formula from Ludvig Prinn's De Vermis Mysteriis. "</p><p>海沃德从我手中接过小球，匆忙地看着我的脸。“那就是开始。”他停顿了会儿，说。“这是一种药物。是的，”他继续看着我们震惊的神情。“我一直在吃。哦，不是大麻或鸦片，我希望它是！这糟糕得多——我从路德维希·蒲林(Ludvig Prinn)的《蠕虫的秘密》(De Vermis Mysteriis)中得到了配方。”</p><p>"What?" I was startled. "Where did you—"</p><p>“什么？”我被吓了一跳。“你从哪儿——”</p><p>Hayward coughed. "As a matter of fact, Gene, I had to resort to a little bribery. The book's kept in a vault in the Huntington Library, you know, but I—I managed to get photostatic copies of the pages I needed."</p><p>海沃德咳嗽了下。“事实上，吉恩，我不得不借助一点行贿的手段。这本书被保存在亨廷顿图书馆的地下室里，你知道的，但我——我设法搞到了我需要的那几页的影印摹本。”</p><p>"What's it all about, this book?" Mason asked, impatiently.</p><p>“这本书是关于什么的?”梅森不耐性地问道。</p><p>"Mysteries of the Worm," I told him. "I've seen it mentioned in dispatches at the paper. It's one of the tabooed references—we've got orders to delete it from any story in which it appears."</p><p>“《蠕虫的秘密》(Mysteries of the Worm)，”我告诉他。“我在报纸的报道中见到过。这是禁止引用的内容之一——我们接到命令，要把它从任何它出现的报道中删除。”</p><p>"Such things are kept hushed up," Hayward said. "Scarcely anyone in California knows that such a book exists in the Huntington Library. Books like that aren't for general knowledge. You see, the man who wrote it was supposed to be an old Flemish sorcerer, who had learned forbidden lore and evil magic—and who wrote the book while he was in prison awaiting trial for witchcraft. The volume's been suppressed by the authorities in every country in which it's been issued. In it I found the formula for this drug."</p><p>“这样的东西是被保密的，”海沃德说。“在加州，几乎没有人知道亨廷顿图书馆里有着这样的一本书。那样的书并非是为寻常的学问而生。你看，写这书的人被认为是一个老佛兰德巫师，他精通禁断的学问与邪恶的魔法——写这本书的时候，他正于监狱中等待着巫术审判。这本书在每个它曾发行的国家里都被当局查禁。我在它里面找到了这种药的配方。”</p><p>He rattled the pellets in his hand. "It's—I may as well tell you—it's the source of my weird stories. It has a powerfully stimulating effect on the imagination."</p><p>他捏着手中的小丸，咯咯作响。“这——我不妨告诉你——这就是我那些怪奇故事的来源。它对想象力有着强烈的刺激作用。”</p><p>"What are its effects?" I asked.</p><p>“它有什么效果？”我问道。</p><p>"It's a time drug," Hayward said, and watched us.</p><p>“这是一种时间药物。”海沃德看着我们说。</p><p>We stared back at him.</p><p>我们回望着他。</p><p>"I don't mean that the drug will enable the user to move in time—no. Not physically, at any rate. But by taking this drug I have been able to remember certain things that I have never experienced in this life.</p><p>“我并不是说这种药物能让使用者在时间中行动——不。至少不是身体上的。但是通过服用这种药物，我能够记住一些我这辈子从未经历过的事情。”</p><p>"The drug enables one to recall his ancestral memories," he went on swiftly, earnestly. "What's so strange about that? I am able to remember past lives, previous reincarnations. You've heard of transmigration of souls—over one-half the population of the world believes in it. It's the doctrine that the soul leaves the body at death to enter another—like the hermit crab, moving from one shell to another."</p><p>“这种药能使人回想起祖先的记忆，”他急切而又诚恳地继续说下去。“这有什么奇怪的呢？我能记起前世，早先的轮回。你们听说过灵魂轮回——世界上有一半以上的人相信它。这是一种学说，灵魂死后离开身体，又进入另一个身体——就像寄居蟹，从一个壳迁居到另一个壳。”</p><p>"Impossible," I said. But I was remembering my strange flash of memory while I was examining one of the pellets.</p><p>“不可能，”我说。但我正想着我在检查其中一颗小丸之时，记忆的奇怪闪现。</p><p>"And why?" Hayward demanded. "Surely the soul, the living essence, has a memory. And if that hidden, submerged memory can be dragged from the subconscious into the conscious—the old mystics had strange powers and stranger knowledge, Gene. Don't forget that I've taken the drug."</p><p>“为什么呢？”海沃德逼问。“灵魂，活着的本质，当然有记忆。如果那些隐藏的，被淹没的记忆可以从潜意识中被拉到表意识中——老神秘主义者们有着奇怪的力量和更奇怪的知识，吉恩。别忘了我已经服了药。”</p><p>"What was it like?" Mason wanted to know.</p><p>“它感觉怎么样呢？”梅森想知道。</p><p>"It was—well, like a flood of memory being poured into my mind—like a moving picture being unfolded—I can't make it clearer than that.”</p><p>“这就——好吧，就像是记忆的潮水般涌入我的脑海——像一幅被展开的动态画面——我无法把它表达得更清楚了。”</p><p>"It brought me to Italy, the first time. It was during the Borgia reign. I can remember it vividly—plots and counterplots, and finally a flight to France, where I—or rather this ancestor of mine—died in a tavern brawl. It was very vivid, very real."</p><p>“第一次，它把我带到了意大利。那是在波吉亚统治时期。我可以生动地记得它来——情节与反转，最终搭上前往法国的航班，在那里，我——或者更确切地说，我的这位祖宗——死在酒馆里的斗殴中。它非常生动，非常真实。”</p><p>"I've kept taking the drug ever since, although it isn't habit- forming. After I wake up from my dream-state—it takes from two to four hours, generally—my mind feels clear, free, unleashed. That's when I do my writing."</p><p>“从那以后，我一直在服药，虽然还没有形成习惯。当我从梦景中醒来——通常需要两到四个小时——我的大脑会感到清晰，自由，释放。那就是我写作的时候。”</p><p>"You have no idea how far back these ancestral memories go. Generations, ages, inconceivable eons! Back to Genghis Khan, back to Egypt and Babylon—and further than that, back to the fabulous sunken lands of Mu and Atlantis. It was in those first primal memories, in a land which exists today only as a memory and a myth, that I first encountered those things—the horror you saw tonight. They existed on Earth then, uncounted millennia ago. And I—"</p><p>“你没法想象能回溯的这些祖先的记忆有多久远。世代，纪元，难以置信的万古！回溯至成吉思汗时期，回溯至埃及与巴比伦——比那再往前，回溯至传说中的沉没的姆大陆与亚特兰蒂斯。在那些最初的记忆中，在这片今天只存在于记忆和神话中的土地上，我第一次遭遇了那些事情——你们今夜所见之恐怖。牠们数千年前就已存在于地球之上。然后我——”</p><p>Again the skirling, shrill cry shrieked out. This time it sounded as if it came from directly above the cottage. I felt a sudden pang of cold, as though the temperature had taken an abrupt drop. There was a heavy, ominous hush in which the crashing of the surf sounded like the thunder of great drums.</p><p>刺耳的尖叫声再次响起。这一次，牠的声音听起来好像是从小屋正上方传来的。我突然感到一阵寒冷，仿若气温骤然下降。海浪拍岸的声音好像巨大的鼓声，其中有种沉重而不祥的寂静。</p><p>Sweat was standing out in beads on Hayward's forehead.</p><p>像珠子一样的汗水从海沃德的额头上冒了出来。</p><p>"I've called them to Earth," he muttered dully, his shoulders drooping. "The Mysteries of the Worm gave a list of precautions to be taken before using the drug—the Pnakotic pentagon, the cabalistical signs of protection—things you wouldn't understand. The book gave terrible warnings of what might happen if those precautions weren't taken—specifically mentioned those things—'the dwellers in the Hidden World', it called them.</p><p>“我已把牠们召唤到了地球上，”他有气无力地嘟囔着，双肩低垂着。“《蠕虫的秘密》为我们提供了在使用这种药物之前要采取的一系列预防措施——纳克特五角星(the Pnakotic Pentagon)，防御的神秘符号——你们不会明白的东西。这本书给出了可怕的警告，如果不采取这些预防措施，可能会发生什么——特别提到了这些东西——牠们被称为，‘隐秘世界的居民(the dwellers in the Hidden World)’。”</p><p>"But I—I neglected finally to safeguard myself. I didn't foresee— I thought I might get a stronger effect from the drug if I didn't take the directed precautions, improve my stories. I unbarred the gateway, and called them to Earth again."</p><p>“但我——我最后忘了保护自己。我没有预见到——我想如果我不采取针对性的预防措施，我可能会从药物中获得更强的效果，从而增进我的故事。我拉开门闩，将它们再次召唤到地球上来。”</p><p>He stared into space, his eyes blank and unseeing. "I have committed terrible sin by my neglect," he muttered, it seemed to himself.</p><p>他望着天空，眼里尽是茫然。“我因疏忽而犯了大罪，”他自言自语地说。</p><p>Mason was suddenly on his feet, his whole body shaking. "I can't stay here! It'll drive us all mad. It's only an hour's drive to Santa Barbara—I can't stand this waiting, waiting, with that thing outside gloating over us!"</p><p>梅森突然站了起来，他浑身发抖。“我不能呆在这儿了！它会让我们全都变疯。开车去圣巴巴拉只需要一个小时——我不能忍受这样的等待，等待，与那正对着我们沾沾自喜的东西！”</p><p>Was Mason, too, losing his nerve? His mind? In the face of this unseen menace, whatever it was?</p><p>难道梅森也失去了他的勇气？他的理智？面对这种看不见的威胁，它到底是什么?</p><p>Sea birds, a mirage of spray—men, perhaps—were responsible for Mason's fear—I tried to tell myself that.</p><p>众海鸟，浪花的海市蜃楼——或许是人们——造成了梅森的恐惧——我试着告诉自己。</p><p>But deep in my heart I knew that no ordinary fear could have driven my two companions to the verge of craven hysteria. And I knew that I felt a strange reluctance to go out into that brooding, silent darkness on the beach.</p><p>但在我的内心深处，我知道任何寻常的恐惧都不能把我这两个同伴逼到胆怯地濒临歇斯底里。我知道我感到一种奇怪的不愿，不愿去到海滩上那阴郁而寂静的黑暗中。</p><p>"No," Hayward said. "We can't—that'd be walking right into the thing. We'll be all right in here—"</p><p>“不，”海沃德说。“我们不能——那样就是直接撞到那东西上去了。我们在这里会没事的——”</p><p>But there was no reassurance in his voice.</p><p>但他的嗓音并不让人安心。</p><p>"I can't stay here doing nothing!" Mason shouted. "I tell you, we'll all go crazy. Whatever that thing is—I've got my gun. And I'll stake bullets against it any time. I'm not staying here!"</p><p>“我不能呆在这里什么都不做!”梅森大叫着。“我告诉你，我们都会发疯的。不管那东西到底是什么——我有我的枪。我随时会对着牠开枪。我不呆在这儿了!”</p><p>He was beside himself. A short time ago the thought of venturing outside the cottage had seemed horrible to him; now he welcomed it as an escape from nerve-racking inaction. He pulled a vicious, flat automatic from his pocket, strode to the door.</p><p>他发狂了。不久之前，一想到要冒险出到小屋外面，他就觉得可怕。他现在却欢迎它，并将其看作是一种逃避令人心烦之不作为的方式。他从口袋里掏出一把凶狠而扁平的自动手枪，大步走向门口。</p><p>Hayward was on his feet, stark horror in his eyes. "For the love of God, don't open that door!" he shouted.</p><p>海沃德站了起来，眼里充斥着极度的恐惧。“看在上帝的份上，别打开那扇门!”他大喊。</p><p>But Mason flung open the door, ignoring him. A gust of icy wind blew in upon us. Outside fog was creeping in, sending greasy tendrils coiling like tentacles toward the doorway.</p><p>但梅森猛然推开门，无视了他。一阵寒风吹向我们。外面的雾气爬进屋子，油腻的卷须像触手一般缠绕着伸向门口。</p><p>"Shut the door!" Hayward screamed as he lunged across the room. I made a hasty move forward as Mason sprang out into the darkness. I collided with Hayward, went reeling. I heard the gritty crunch of Mason's footsteps on the sand—and something else.</p><p>“把门关上！”海沃德尖叫着向房间那头冲去。梅森跃入黑暗之时，我急忙向前走了一步。我撞到海沃德身上，头一晕。我听到梅森在沙地上嘎吱的脚步声——以及别的什么。</p><p>A shrill, mewing cry. Somehow—fierce, exultant. And it was answered from the distance by other cries, as though dozens of sea birds were wheeling high above us, unseen in the fog.</p><p>一声刺耳的海鸥叫。某种——凶猛的，狂欢的。并从远方得到了其他叫声的回应，好像有几十只海鸟在我们头顶上盘旋，处于雾中，不得看见。</p><p>I heard another strange little sound—I couldn't classify it. It sounded vaguely like a shout that had been clipped off abruptly. There was a rushing howl of winds and I saw Hayward clinging to the door, staring out as though stupefied.</p><p>我听到另一个奇怪的微小声音——我无法为其归类，这声音听起来含糊不清，像一声突然被扼住的叫喊。狂风咆号而过，我看见海沃德紧紧抓着门，吓呆了似的望着外面。</p><p>In a moment I saw why. Mason had vanished—utterly and completely, as though he had been borne off by a bird of prey. There was the empty beach, the low dunes to the left—but not a sign of Bill Mason.</p><p>在那一刻，我看明了为何。梅森消失了——彻彻底底，完完全全，仿佛他被一只猛禽叼了去。只留下空荡的沙滩，以及左边低矮的沙丘——但却不见比尔·梅森的踪影。</p><p>I was dazed. He couldn't have sprinted from sight during the brief time my eyes had been turned away. Nor could he have hidden beneath the house, for it was boarded down to the sand.</p><p>我是茫然的。他不可能在我目光转离的短暂时间里极速跑出视野。他也不可能藏在房子下面，因为房子是用木板钉在沙地上的。</p><p>Hayward turned a white, lined face to me. "They've got him," he whispered. "He wouldn't listen to me. Their first victim—God knows what will happen now."</p><p>海沃德将那苍白，布满皱纹的脸转向我。“牠们已经得到他了，”他低语着。“他不听我的。牠们的第一个牺牲品——天知道现在会发生什么。”</p><p>Nevertheless we searched. It was in vain. Bill Mason had vanished. We went as far as his car, but he wasn't there.</p><p>可是我们的搜索是徒劳的，比尔·梅森已经消失了。我们一直走他的车，但他并不在那里。</p><p>If the keys of the car had been in the dashboard, I might have urged Hayward to get into the car with me, to race from that haunted beach. I was growing afraid, but I dared not admit my fear even to myself.</p><p>如果那辆车的钥匙还在仪表盘上，我也许会劝海沃德跟我一起上车，从那个被搅扰的海滩出发。我越来越害怕，但我不敢承认我的恐惧，甚至不敢对自己承认。</p><p>We went back to the cottage slowly.</p><p>我们缓慢地回到小屋。</p><p>"It's only a few hours ‘til dawn," I said after we had sat and stared at each other for a while. "Mason—we can find him then."</p><p>“离天明只有几个小时了，”我们坐下来对视了一会儿后，我说。“梅森——我们到时候能找到他。”</p><p>"We'll never find him," Hayward said dully. "He's in some hellish world we can't even imagine. He may even be in another dimension."</p><p>“我们永远都不能找到他了，”海沃德没精打采地说。“他在一个我们甚至无法想象的，地狱般的世界里。他甚至可能在另一个维度里。”</p><p>I shook my head stubbornly. I couldn't, wouldn't believe. There must be some logical explanation, and I dared not lower my defenses of skepticism and disbelief.</p><p>我固执地摇摇头，我不能，也不会相信。一定有某种合乎逻辑的解释，我不敢降低我对怀疑与不信的防御。</p><p>After a time we heard a shrill mewing from outside. It came again, and then several sharp cries at once. I lit a cigarette with trembling fingers, got up and paced the room nervously.</p><p>过了会儿，我们听到外面传来一声刺耳的海鸥叫。牠又来了，接着立刻发出几声尖锐的叫声。我用颤抖的手指点燃一支香烟，站起身来，紧张地在房中踱来踱去。</p><p>"That damned drug," I heard Hayward muttering. "It's opened the gateway—I have committed sin—"</p><p>“这该死的药。”我听见海沃德嘟囔着。“它打开了大门——我犯了罪——”</p><p>I paused, my attention caught by a word, a sentence, on a sheet of paper in Hayward's typewriter. I ripped it from the platen.</p><p>我停住脚步，注意力被海沃德的打字机上一张纸上中的一个词，一段句子吸引住了。我把它从压印板上扯下来了。</p><p>"Material for a story," Hayward said bitterly, glancing up at the sound. "I wrote that two nights ago, when I first got the memory of the things. I've told you how those damnable pills work. I got the—the memory in the afternoon, and sat down to hammer out a story from it that night. I was—interrupted."</p><p>"一个故事的素材，"海沃德抬眼一瞥，用那声音痛苦地说。“这是我两个晚上前写的，那时我刚得到了那东西的记忆。我已经告诉过你那些该死的药丸是怎么起作用的。在下午，我得到了——了记忆，在那晚，我坐下来敲打着故事，我被——打断了。”</p><p>I didn't answer. I was reading, fascinated, that half-page of type. And as I read, an eerie spell of horror seemed to settle down over me, like a chill shroud of dank fog. For in that eldritch legend Hayward had written, there were certain disturbing hints of things that made my mind shudder away from their frightfulness, even while I recognized them.</p><p>我没有回应，我正在阅读，深深着迷于那半页纸中。我读着读着，一种恐怖的怪异魔咒笼罩着我，就像一层由潮雾构成的阴冷裹尸布。因为在海沃德所写的那个可怕传说中，有一些令人不安的暗示，即使在我认出牠们的时候，也会使我的心因牠们的可怕而战栗。</p><p>The manuscript read:</p><p>稿子上写着：</p><p>I dwelt in an archaic world. A world that had been long forgotten when Atlantis and Cimmeria flourished, a world so incredibly ancient that none of its records have ever come down through the ages.</p><p>我生活在一个古老的世界。当亚特兰提斯与辛梅利亚繁荣昌盛之时，这个世界就已被长久遗忘，这是一个极度古老的世界，其记载从未流传下来。</p><p>The first human race dwelt in primal Mu, worshiping strange, forgotten gods—mountain-tall Cthulhu of the Watery Abyss, the Serpent Yig, Iod the Shining Hunter, Vorvadoss of the Gray Gulf of Yarnak.</p><p>最早的人类居住在原始的姆，崇拜奇怪的，被遗忘的众神——水渊中如山高的克苏鲁，大蛇伊格，闪耀的猎户伊欧德，亚纳克灰色深渊的沃瓦多斯。</p><p>And in those days there came to Earth certain beings form another dimension of space, inhuman, monstrous creatures which desired to wipe out all life from the planet. These beings planned to leave their own dying world to colonize Earth, building their titanic cities on this younger, more fruitful planet.</p><p>在那些时日里，牠们来到地球，形成了另一个空间维度，渴望消灭地球上所有生命的，非人的怪异生物。这些存在计划离开牠们自己垂死的世界去开拓地球，在这个更年轻、更富饶的星球上建造他们的巨型城市。</p><p>With their coming a tremendous conflict sprang into being, in which the gods friendly to mankind were arrayed against the hostile invaders.</p><p>随着牠们的到来，一场巨大的冲突爆发了，其中，与人类友好的神明被组列去对抗怀有敌意的侵入者。</p><p>Foremost in that cyclopean battle, mightiest of Earth's gods, was the Flaming One, Vorvadoss of Bel-Yarnak, and I, high priest of his cult, kindled</p><p>在这场惊人的战役中，地球上最强大的神，是燃烧者(the Flaming One)，贝尔-亚纳克的沃瓦多斯，还有我，他教宗的大祭司，燃起</p><p>There the manuscript ended.</p><p>稿子就此结束。</p><p>Hayward had been watching me. "That was my—dream, Gene, when I last took the time-drug. It wasn't quite as clear as most of them—there are always blind spots, odd gaps where my memory somehow doesn't work. But the drug showed me what had happened in that prehistoric lifetime of mine, so many incarnations ago. We won—or rather our gods won. The invaders—those things—"</p><p>海沃德一直在观察着我。“吉恩，那是当我最后一次服用时间之药时，我的——梦景。它不像它们大多数时候那样清楚——总是有盲点，奇怪的缺口，我的记忆不知怎地不起作用了。但是药物让我看到了在我的史前生命中发生的事情，那是很久以前的事了。我们赢了——或者说我们的众神赢了。侵入者——那些东西——”</p><p>He broke off as a mewing cry sounded, very near, and then resumed in an unsteady voice. "They were driven back into their own world, their own dimension—and the gateway was closed, so they could not return. It's remained closed through all these eons.”</p><p>当一声海鸥叫响起时他停住了，那声音非常近，然后他用颤抖的声音说。“牠们被赶回自己的世界，自己的维度——可门被关上了，所以他们无法归来。历经万古依旧闭锁着。”</p><p>"It would still be closed," he went on bitterly. "If I hadn't opened it with my experiments, or had taken the precautions the Mysteries of the Worm gave. Now they've got Mason—and that's all they need. I know that, somehow. A sacrifice to open the gate between this world and their own frightful dimension, so that their hordes can come pouring upon Earth—</p><p>“它本应仍被关闭，”他痛苦地继续说下去。“如果我没有通过我的实验来打开它，或者没有采取《蠕虫的秘密》所提供的预防措施。现在他们得到了梅森——这就是他们所有的一切。我知道，以某种方式。使用一个祭品可以打开这个世界和牠们自己的可怕维度之间的大门，让牠们的群体能够涌向地球——</p><p>"That's how they got in before. By a human sacrifice—"</p><p>“牠们以前就是这样进来的。通过活人献祭——”</p><p>"Listen!" I held up my hand urgently. The mewing cries had died, but there was another sound—a faint high-pitched moaning coming from outside the cottage. Hayward didn't move.</p><p>“听！”我急切地举起手。海鸥的叫声消失了，但还有另一种声音——从小屋外面传来一声微弱的尖细呻吟。海沃德没有移动。</p><p>"It may be Mason," I jerked out as I went to the door. Momentarily I hesitated, and then swung it open, stepped out on the sand. The moaning grew louder. Hayward slowly came up by my side. His eyes were sharper than mine, for as he peered into the fog banks he gave a startled exclamation.</p><p>“这可能是梅森，”当我走到门前，我猛然说出。我犹豫了片刻，随后拉开门，走到沙地上。呻吟声越来越响。海沃德缓缓来到我旁边。他的眼神比我敏锐，当他凝视着雾气缭绕的浅滩时，发出了一声惊叫。</p><p>"Good God!" He flung out his arm, pointing. "Look at that!"</p><p>“我的上帝!”他伸出他的胳膊，指着。“看那边!”</p><p>Then I, too, saw it, and I stood there glaring at the thing, unable to move.</p><p>然后，我也看见了牠，我站在那里一动不动，瞪着那东西。</p><p>There on that Pacific beach, with the yellow light from the open door pouring out into the fog, something was dragging itself painfully over the sand toward us—something distorted, misshapen, uttering little whimpering cries as it pulled itself along. It came into the beam of light and we saw it distinctly.</p><p>在太平洋的海滩上，自敞开的门里射出来的黄光倾泻于雾中，有什么东西在沙地上向我们痛苦地拖着自己——那东西扭曲，畸形，它一边前进一边发出呜咽的叫声。它爬进光线，我们可以清楚地看见它。</p><p>Beside me, Hayward was swaying back and forth, making hoarse sounds as though he were trying to scream and couldn't. I stumbled back, flinging up my arm to shield my horrified eyes, croaking, "Keep away! For God's sake, stay back—you—you—you're not Bill Mason—damn you, stay back!"</p><p>海沃德在我旁边晃来晃去，发出嘶哑的声音，好像他想尖叫，但却喊不出来。我踉踉跄跄地后退，举起胳膊挡住惊恐的眼睛，嘶哑地说：“离远点儿！看在上帝的份上，往后退——你——你——你不是比尔·梅森——该死的，退后！”</p><p>But the thing kept on crawling toward us. The black, sightless hollows where its eyes had been were grim shadows in the dim light. It had been flayed alive, and its hands left red marks on the sand as it crept. A patch of bare white skull shone like a frightful tonsure on the crimsoned head.</p><p>但那东西一直朝着我们爬来。在昏暗的光线下，它眼睛所在的黑色，看不见的凹陷形成了可怕的阴影。它被活生生地剥了皮，当它匍匐爬行之时，其手在沙子上留下了红色的痕迹。在那颗被染红了的脑袋上，一块裸露着的白色头骨闪着光，仿佛是个可怕的秃顶。</p><p>Nor was that all—but I cannot bring myself to describe the dreadful and loathsomely abnormal changes that had taken place in the body of the thing that had been Bill Mason. And even as it crawled it was—changing!</p><p>这还不是全部——但我无法让自己去描述发生在比尔·梅森身上的可怕而令人厌恶的异常变化。甚至在它爬行之时——变化仍在继续！</p><p>A dreadful metamorphosis was overtaking it. It seemed to be losing its outline, to sprawl down until it wriggled rather than crawled along the sand. Then I knew! In the space of seconds it was reversing the entire evolutionary upsurge of the human species! It squirmed there like a snake, losing its resemblance to anything human as I watched, sick and shuddering. It melted and shrank and shriveled until there was nothing left but a loathsome foul ichor that was spreading in a black puddle of odious black slime. I heard myself gasping hysterical, unintelligible prayers. And suddenly a piercing shock of cold went through me. High in the fog I heard a mewing, shrill call.</p><p>直到它不是在沙地上爬行，而是在蠕动之时，它似乎失去了轮廓，成了一摊东西。然后我知道！一场可怕的变形正发生在它身上。在几秒钟的时间里，它就逆转了整个人类物种进化的高潮！它失去了任何与人类的相似之处，像蛇一般在那里蠕动着。当我注视着它时，感到一阵恶心，并且战栗不已。它溶解，萎缩，干枯，除了一滩不断淌开的，可憎而污秽的黏稠脓液，什么都不剩。我听见自己在歇斯底里地喘着粗气，胡乱祈祷着。突然，一阵刺骨的寒意袭上全身。我听见自雾气高处，传来一声刺耳的海鸥叫。</p><p>Hayward clutched at my arm, his eyes blazing. "It's come," he whispered. "It's the sacrifice—they're breaking through!"</p><p>海沃德紧紧抓住我的胳膊，眼睛里闪着光。“牠来了，”他低声说。“这是祭品——他们正在突破！”</p><p>I swung about, leaped for the open door of the cottage. The icy, unnatural chill was numbing my body, slowing my movements. "Come on," I shouted to Hayward. "You fool, don't stay out there! There has been one sacrifice already! Must there be others?"</p><p>我转身一跃，奔向小屋敞开的门。冰冷而反常的寒意令我身体麻木，行动迟缓。“快过来，"我对海沃德喊道。“你这个笨蛋，别呆在外面！已经有一个牺牲者了！必须还要有别人的吗？”</p><p>He flung himself into the house and I slammed and locked the door.</p><p>他冲进屋中，我砰地一声锁上了门。</p><p>Shrill, unearthly cries were coming from all directions now, as though the things were calling and answering one another. I thought I sensed a new note in the cries—a note of expectation, of triumph.</p><p>现在四面八方都传来了可怕的尖叫声，仿佛那些东西在相互呼应。我想我在这些叫声中感觉到一种新的音调——一种期待的音调，一种胜利的音调。</p><p>The window shade rolled up with a rattle and a snap, and the fog began to move past the pane, coiling and twisting fantastically. At a sudden gust the window shook in its casing. Hayward said under his breath, "Atmospheric disturbances—oh, my God! Poor Mason—watch the door, Gene!" His voice was strangled.</p><p>随着咔哒一声，窗帘卷了起来，雾气拂过窗格，奇特地缠卷转绕着。一阵突来的狂风使窗框摇晃起来。海沃德压低嗓音，说：“常压扰乱——哦，我的天呐！可怜的梅森——吉恩，看门！”他声音骤止。</p><p>For a moment I saw nothing. Then the door bulged inward as though frightful pressure had been applied from without. A panel cracked with a rending sound, and I caught my breath. Then—it was gone.</p><p>一时之间，我什么也没有看见。接着，那扇门向里鼓起，仿佛从外面受到了惊人的压力。木板破开了，发出撕裂的声音，我屏住了呼吸。然后——它不见了。</p><p>The metal doorknob had a white rime of frost on it. "This— this isn't real," I said madly, although I was shuddering in the icy cold.</p><p>金属门把手上结了一层白霜。“这——这不是真的，”我发狂地说，尽管我在寒冷中发着抖。</p><p>"Real enough. They're breaking through—"</p><p>“这够真的了。他们正在突破——“</p><p>Then Hayward said something so strange that it brought me around sharply, staring at him. Gazing vacantly at me, like a man in a hypnagogic state, he muttered in a queer gutteral voice, "The fires burn on Nergu-K'nyan and the Watchers scan the night skies for the Enemies—ny'ghan tharanak grit—"</p><p>接着海沃德说了一句非常奇怪的话，使我猛地转过身来，两眼直勾勾地盯着他。他茫然地望着我，像是个处于催眠状态的人，用一种古怪的喉音低声说：“战火在Nergu-K'nyan燃烧，观察者(the Watchers)们扫视夜空，寻找敌人——ny'ghan tharanak 移动——”</p><p>"Hayward!" I seized his shoulders, shook him. Life came back into his eyes.</p><p>“海沃德！”我抓着他的肩膀，晃着他。他的双眼又恢复了生气。</p><p>"Blind spot," he muttered. "I remembered something—now it's gone—"</p><p>“盲点，”他咕哝着，“我想起来了些什么——现在它不见了——”</p><p>He flinched as a new outburst of the mewing cries came from above the house.</p><p>当屋子上方又响起一阵海鸥叫时，他畏惧了。</p><p>But a strange, an incredible surmise, had burst upon my brain. There was a way out, a key of deliverance from evil—Hayward had it and did not know it!</p><p>但是，我突然有了种奇怪而不可思议的猜想。有一条出路，是摆脱邪恶之键——海沃德有，可他却不知道！</p><p>"Think," I said breathlessly. "Think hard! What was it—that memory?"</p><p>“想想，”我气喘吁吁地说。“仔细想想！那是什么——什么记忆?”</p><p>"Does that matter now? This—" He saw the expression on my face, its meaning flashed across to him and he answered, not quickly, not slowly, but dreamily: "I seemed to be on a mountain peak, standing before the altar of Vorvadoss, with a great fire flaming up into the darkness. Around me there were priests in white robes—Watchers—"</p><p>“跟现在有关系吗？这——”他看到了我脸上的表情，明白了其中的含义，他回答着，语速不是很快，也不是很慢，而是像做梦一样：“我仿佛站在山巅之上，站在沃瓦多斯的祭坛前，巨大的火焰在黑暗中燃烧。我的周围有穿着白袍子的祭司——观察者们——”</p><p>"Hayward," I cried. "Vorvadoss—look here!" I snatched up the half-page of the manuscript, read from it hastily. "The gods friendly to man were arrayed against the invaders—"</p><p>“海沃德，”我喊着。“沃瓦多斯——看这里！”我抓起那半页稿子，匆匆地读了起来。“与人类友好的神明被组列去对抗怀有敌意的侵入者——”</p><p>"I see what you mean!" Hayward cried. "We triumphed—then. But now—"</p><p>“我明白你的意思！”海沃德喊着。“我们之后获胜了。但现在——”</p><p>"Hayward!" I persisted desperately. "Your flash of memory just now! You were standing on a mountain while the Watchers scanned the night skies for the Enemies, you said. The Enemies must have been those creatures. Suppose the Watchers saw them?"</p><p>“海沃德！”我极力坚持。“你刚刚闪现的记忆！你说，当观察者们扫视夜空搜寻敌人之时，你站在一座山上。敌人一定是那些造物。假如观察者们看见了他们？”</p><p>Suddenly the house shook under an impact that was not the work of the screaming wind. God! Would my efforts bear fruit too late? I heard an outburst of the shrill cries, and the door creaked and splintered. It was dreadfully cold. We were flung against the wall, and I staggered, almost losing my balance.</p><p>突然，房子摇晃起来，这并非呼号狂风的作为。天呐！我努力的结果会不会来得太晚？我听到一声尖叫，门嘎吱嘎吱地碎裂了。天气冷得可怕，我们撞到墙上，我踉踉跄跄，几乎失去了平衡。</p><p>Again the house rocked under another battering-ram impact. My teeth were chattering, and I could hardly speak. A black dizziness was creeping up to overwhelm me, and my hands and feet had lost all feeling. Out of a whirling sea of darkness I saw Hayward's white face.</p><p>房子因又一次的撞击再度摇撼起来。我的牙齿打颤着，说不出话来。一阵邪恶的眩晕漫过我身，致使手脚麻木。在茫茫黑暗之中，我看见海沃德那苍白的脸庞。</p><p>"It's a chance," I gasped, fighting back the blackness. "Wouldn't there—have been some way of summoning the gods, the friendly gods—if the Watchers saw the Enemies? You—you were high priest—in that former life. You'd know— how—to summon—"</p><p>“这是一个机会，”我喘着气，抵抗着黑暗。“难道没有——没有一种召唤诸神，诸善神的方法——如果观察者们看见了敌人？你——你是大祭司——在前世。你知道——如何——去召唤——”</p><p>The door crashed, broke. I heard wood being torn ruthlessly apart, but I dared not turn.</p><p>门被崩裂，破开。我听见木头被无情地撕裂，但我不敢回头。</p><p>"Yes!" Hayward cried. "I remember—there was a word!"</p><p>“是的！”海沃德喊着。“我记得——有一个词！”</p><p>I saw his frightened gaze shift past me to the horror that I knew was ripping at the broken door. I fumbled for his shoulders, managed to turn him away. "You must! Think, man—"</p><p>我看见他将目光从未身旁移开，惊骇地望着我所知道的，正在撕裂破门的恐怖。我摸索到他的双肩，极力把他推开。“伙计，你必须！想想——”</p><p>Abruptly a light flared in his eyes. He was reacting at last.</p><p>他眼里突然灵光一闪，终于有了反应。</p><p>He flung up his arms and began a weird, sonorous chant. Strangely archaic-sounding words flowed from his tongue fluently, easily. But now I had no eyes for him—I was glaring at the horror that was squeezing itself through the splintered gap it had torn in the wall.</p><p>他张开双臂，开始响亮地吟唱着。那些语言古老且怪异，可他的发音却是那番轻松流畅。但现在，我已失去了对他的关注——我瞪着眼睛，看着那恐怖的东西正往牠在墙上所划的裂口里挤着。</p><p>It was the thing Hayward had sketched, revealed in all its loathsome reality!</p><p>这正是海沃德所画的东西，它的一切丑恶，尽都被真切地揭露。</p><p>My dizziness, my half-fainting state, saved me from seeing the thing too clearly. As it was, a scream of utter horror ripped from my throat as I saw, through a spinning whirlpool of darkness, a squamous, glowing ball covered with squirming, snake-like tentacles—translucent ivory flesh, leprous and hideous—a great faceted eye that held the cold stare of the Midgard serpent. I seemed to be dropping, spinning, falling helplessly down toward a welter of writhing, glossy tentacles—and dimly I could hear Hayward still chanting.</p><p>我头晕眼花，处于半昏迷状态，致使我看不大清事物。就在这时，我发出一声极度恐惧的尖叫，我看到在一个旋转的黑暗漩涡中，有一个发光的，不洁而可怕的有鳞球体，上面长着像蛇一样蠕动着的，乳白色半透明的触手。还有一只巨大的多面眼睛，像米德加尔特之蛇一样冷冷的盯着我。我似乎正朝着一团缠绕着的，光滑的触手无助地旋转坠落——隐约间，我听见海沃德仍在吟唱。</p><p>"la! Rhyn tharanak ... Vorvadoss of Bel-Yarnak! The Troubler of the Sands! Thou Who waiteth in the Outer Dark, Kindler of the Flame ... n'gha shuggy'haa ..."</p><p>“la! Rhyn tharanak ... 贝尔-亚纳克的沃瓦多斯！沙漠的扰乱者！火焰的点燃者(Kindler of the Flame)，你在外界黑暗中等待…n'gha shuggy'haa ……”</p><p>He pronounced a Word. A Word of Power, which my stunned ears could scarcely hear. Yet hear it I did. And I felt that beyond the borders of human consciousness and understanding, that Word was flashing and thundering, through the intergalactic spaces to the farthest abyss. And in primeval night and chaos Something heard, and rose up, and obeyed the summons.</p><p>他念出了一段话语，一段有力的言辞。它震动着我的耳朵，让我几乎听不见。但我还是听到了。我感觉到，在人类意识和理解的边界之外，这个词闪烁着，轰鸣着，穿越星际，抵达最遥远的深渊。在这原始的黑夜与混乱中，有什么东西听到了，升了起来，并应允了召唤。</p><p>For, with the suddenness of a thunderclap, blackness fell on the room, hiding from my sight the monstrous glowing thing that was plunging toward us. I heard a dreadful skirling cry—and then there was utter silence, in which I could not even hear the recurrent crashing of the surf. The abysmal cold sent sharp flashes of pain through me.</p><p>正当那发光的怪物朝我们扑来之时，随着突然的一声霹雳，黑暗降临在房中，挡住了我的视线。我听到了一声可怕的尖叫——接着是一片全然的寂静，我甚至听不见海浪反复拍打的声音。极度的寒冷使我感到一阵剧痛。</p><p>Then, out of the darkness, there rose up before us a Face. I saw it through a haze of silvery mist that clung about it like a veil. It was utterly inhuman, for the half-seen features were arranged in a pattern different to mankind, seeming to follow the strange pattern of some unfamiliar and alien geometry. Yet it did not frighten, it calmed.</p><p>然后，从黑暗中，在我们面前出现了一张脸。我透过一层仿若面纱的银色薄雾看到了它。它是全然的非人，因为那些隐约可见的五官并非按照人类的方式排列，而是似乎遵循一些陌生的几何模式。但它没有恐惧，反倒是平静的。</p><p>Through the silver mist I made out strange hollows, fantastic curves and planes. Only the eyes were clear, unmistakable—black as the empty wastes between the stars, cold in their unearthly wisdom.</p><p>透过银色的薄雾，我看到了古怪的空洞、奇异的曲线与位面。只有眼睛是清澈而明晰的——如群星间的荒芜虚空那番漆黑，如他们那超凡的智慧那番冰冷。</p><p>There were tiny dancing flames flickering in those eyes, and there were little flames, too, playing over the strange, inhuman countenance. And although not a shadow of emotion passed over those brooding, passionless eyes, I felt a wave of reassurance. Suddenly all fear left me. Beside me, unseen in the darkness, I heard Hayward whisper, "Vorvadoss! The Kindler of the Flame!"</p><p>在那些眼睛里，一些微小的火焰跃动着，闪烁着。在这张陌生且非人的面容上，也有一些小火焰在燃烧。尽管那沉着冷静的眼睛里没有一丝感情的影子，我却觉得无比安慰。突然间，所有的恐惧都离我而去。我听见海沃德在我身旁呢喃着：“沃瓦多斯！火焰的点燃者！”</p><p>Swiftly the darkness receded, the face faded to a shadowy dimness. I was looking, not at the familiar walls of the cottage, but at another world. I had gone down with Hayward into the profundities of the past.</p><p>黑暗迅速退去，那张脸消失在幽暗的朦胧中。我看见的不是那间小屋熟悉的墙壁，而是另一个世界。我与海沃德一同坠入过往的深渊。</p><p>I seemed to be standing in a vast amphitheater of jet, and around me, towering to a sky sprinkled with an infinite multitude of cold stars, I could see a colossal and shocking city of scalene black towers and fortresses, of great masses of stone and metal, arching bridges and cyclopean ramparts. And with racking horror I saw teeming loathsomely in that nightmare city the spawn of that alien dimension.</p><p>我似乎站在一个广阔的，由黑色大理石构成的圆形竞技场上。在我周围，高天之上铺撒着无数冰冷的星星。我可以看见一个巨大而惊人的城邑，有着倾轴的黑塔与堡垒，有着大量的石头与金属，以及拱形的桥梁与耸立的城墙。我惊恐地看见，在这个恶梦般的城市里，到处都是那个陌生维度的产物。</p><p>Hundreds, thousands—surging multitudes of them, hanging motionless in the dark, clear air, resting quiescent on the tiers of the amphitheater, surging across the great cleared spaces. I caught glimpses of glittering eyes, cold and unwinking; pulpy, glowing masses of semi-transparent flesh; monstrous reptilian appendages that swam before my eyes as the things moved loathsomely. I felt contaminated, defiled. I think I shrieked, and my hands flew up to shut out that intolerable vision of lost Abaddon—the dimension of the Invaders.</p><p>成百上千的牠们，或静静地悬在黑暗而清澈的空中，于竞技场的一些层阶上休息，或汹涌地传过在宽阔的空间。我瞥见许多发着光的眼睛，冰冷而且一眨不眨；还有发光的浆状半透明肉块；这些怪异的爬物令人讨厌地移动时，那些附肢在我眼前游来游去。我觉得自己被玷污了。我想我是尖叫了一声，然后我挥起手来，想要驱去那些令人无法忍受的，关于失落的阿巴顿(Abaddon)的景象——侵入者的维度。</p><p>And abruptly that other-world vision snapped out and vanished.</p><p>突然之间，那个异界的幻象消失了。</p><p>I saw the godlike, alien Face fleetingly, felt the cool glance of those strange, omniscient eyes. Then it was gone, and the room seemed to rock and sway in the grip of cosmic forces. As I staggered and almost fell I saw again around me the walls of the cottage.</p><p>我短暂地看见了那张庄严的陌生面孔，感到了那双奇怪且无所不知的眼睛的冷冷一瞥。然后它消失了，房间似乎在宇宙力量的控制之下摇摆不定。当我踉跄着行将摔倒之时，再度看见我周围小屋的墙壁。</p><p>The unbearable chill was no longer in the air; there was no sound but the pounding of the surf. The wind still sent the fog twisting past the window, but the brooding, oppressive feeling of age-old evil had utterly vanished. I sent an apprehensive glance at the shattered door, but there was no trace of the horror that had burst into the cottage.</p><p>空气中不再有难以忍受的寒意，声音不再有了，唯独剩下海浪的拍打声。风仍使雾绕着窗户飘过，但那存在已久的，邪恶的阴郁与压抑之感已经消失殆尽。我忧心忡忡地瞥了眼那扇破碎的门，但没了曾闯入小屋之恐怖的迹象。</p><p>Hayward was leaning limply against the wall, breathing in great gasps. We looked at each other dumbly. Then, moved by a common impulse, we went, half staggering, to the splintered gap where the door had been, out onto the sand.</p><p>海沃德四肢无力地靠在墙上，大口喘气着。我们面面相觑。然后，在同一种冲动的驱使之下，我们半摇晃着走过那扇门原来所在的裂口之外的沙地上。</p><p>The fog was fading, vanishing, torn into tatters by a cool, fresh wind. A starlit patch of night sky glittered above the cottage.</p><p>一股凉爽清新的风，将雾气渐渐撕碎。小屋之上，是一片星光闪烁的夜空。</p><p>"Driven back," Hayward whispered. "As they were once before— back to their own dimension, and the gateway locked. But not before a life was taken by them—the life of our friend—may Heaven forgive me for that—"</p><p>"被赶回去了，"海沃德低声说。“就像他们从前那样——回到牠们自己的空间，大门被锁住。但不在牠们夺走一个人的生命——我们朋友的生命之前——愿上天宽恕我——”</p><p>Suddenly he turned, went stumbling back into the cottage, great dry sobs racking him.</p><p>And my cheeks, too, were wet.</p><p>他突然转过身，跌跌撞撞地回到小屋，他痛苦地大哭着。我的脸颊也湿了。</p><p>He came out. I stood at his side as he threw the time-pellets into the sea. Never again would he go back to the past. He would live henceforth in the present, and a little in the future—as was more fitting, decenter, for human beings to do—</p><p>他走了出去。我站在他身边，看着他把时间药物扔进海里。他再也不会回到过去。他要活在现在，活在未来——这对人类来说更合适，更正确。</p></body></html>
