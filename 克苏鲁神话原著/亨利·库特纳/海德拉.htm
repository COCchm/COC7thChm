<p>亨利·库特纳</p>
<p>译者：莫城幽</p>
<p>你们应该已经很清楚布洛克《外星怪物》的玩笑起源和它的后果，洛夫克拉夫特的《夜魔》以及其结局，布洛克的《尖塔幽灵》。在第一篇中，爱手艺以一位博学的神秘学者登场，他被撒托古亚的化身吞噬。在第二篇里，布洛克变成了罗伯特·布莱特，在奈亚拉托提普其中之一的化身上遭遇了几乎相同的命运。在第三篇中，正如布洛克多年后自己所揭示的，埃德蒙·菲斯基（Edmund Fiske)是布洛克的朋友兼同事弗里茨·莱伯的面具。(有些人把布洛克自己想象成这个角色，因为被与事实不相干的论点，布洛克有时会用塔尔顿·菲斯基这个笔名，弄混了)。在《海德拉》中，我们看见年轻的亨利·库特纳加入了游戏。人物罗伯特·路德维希（Robert Ludwig)一定是罗伯特·布洛克，路德维希·蒲林名字的改变，同时保罗·埃德蒙一定代表了埃德蒙·汉密尔顿（Edmond Hamilton）虽然这个角色的姓氏可能确实来源于此，但1936年12月3日洛夫克拉夫特写给布洛克的一封信透露，保罗·埃德蒙这个角色应该是库特纳本人，而肯尼斯·斯科特（Kenneth Scott）就是洛夫克拉夫特。所有这些都促使我们去推测库特纳自己笔名的来源：难道Keith Hammond gematria不是他早期最喜欢的，后来是朋友埃德蒙·汉密尔顿吗？我想是的。</p>
<p>注意这里提到了一本神秘的书，叫做《六十石》（The Sixtystone）。这是对亚瑟·梅琴和他的伟大故事《黑印的小说》（The Novel of the Black Seal）的致敬，其中，与书名同名的“印”是一个奇特的雕刻多面体，被称为Ixixar，或六十石。当然，库特纳在《塞勒姆恐怖》中已经提到了梅琴，在《入侵者》中也含蓄地提到了他。在《入侵者》中，比尔·梅森最后的退化让人联想到梅琴在《伟大的潘神》（The Great God Pan）中即将死去的海伦·沃恩（Helen Vaughan）。</p>
<p>库特纳从洛夫克拉夫特借用了召唤女神西布莉(Cybele，爱手艺在《墙中鼠》中提到过她)的祷文，“戈贡，魔摩，千面之月”（Gorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon）尽管他在《雷德胡克的恐怖》中使用了这个祷文，并将其作为对莉莉丝的礼拜仪式。最初它二者都不是，而是形成赫卡忒（Hecate）古老仪式的一部分。</p>
<p>最后，神话百科全书的编纂者可能会停顿并困惑滴将目光落在被删去的名字，“法罗尔（Pharol）”上。这是哪个古老神明？你会发现他在库特纳的妻子C. L.摩尔（C. L. Moore）所写的西北史密斯（Northwest Smith）的太空冒险中扮演了重要角色，尤其是在《众神之尘》（Dust of the Gods）中。(参见西北史密斯小说集，Ace Books，1981年。另外四个西北史密斯的故事不包括发生在Karl Wagner (ed.)，Echoes of ValorII, TOR Books，1989年的那卷)。</p>
<p>首次发表：《诡丽幻谭》，1939年4月</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>两个人死了，也许是三个。众所周知，小报以火暴的标题报道了肯尼斯·斯科特（Kenneth Scott）神秘的伤残及死亡，肯尼斯·斯科特是巴尔的摩著名的作家兼神秘学家，后来，他们同样大写了罗伯特·路德维希的失踪，他和斯科特的通信在文学界广为人知。同样奇怪甚至更可怕的保罗·埃德蒙（Paul Edmond）的死亡，虽然与斯科特的恐怖场景相隔了一个大陆，但显然与其有关。这一点可以从埃德蒙僵硬的手里发现了一件人们议论已久的东西就可以看出来——因为他轻信的主张导致了他的死亡。虽然这种解释是不可能的，但保罗·埃德蒙因颈动脉被切断，失血过多而死是真的，而且这个案子的特点，用现代科学的方法也确实难以解释。</p>
<p>小报对埃德蒙的日记做了大量的报道，即使是传统的报纸也很难用一种不会让他们被指控为黄色新闻的方式，来处理这种不寻常的文件。《好莱坞市民新闻》通过引用日记中最不精彩的部分为同时代人解决了这个问题，这显然是在暗示埃德蒙是个小说家，他的笔记从来没有被当成真实事件的总结。在日记中扮演重要角色的那本私人印刷的小册子，《有关灵魂的外放》（On the Sending Out of the Soul），似乎纯粹是虚构的。当地书商没有一位听说过这本书，加州最著名的爱书人拉塞尔·霍奇金斯先生（Mr. Russell Hodgkins）宣称，标题与内容定是出自命运多舛的保罗·埃德蒙之手。</p>
<p>然而，根据埃德蒙的日记和在他书桌里发现的其他一些文件和信件来看，正是这本小册子促使路德维希和埃德蒙进行了这个灾难性的实验。路德维希决定从纽约出发，经由巴拿马运河悠闲地航行，去拜访他的加州通信者。卡纳蒂克号（Carnatic）于八月十五日靠岸，路德维希花了几个小时在圣佩德罗闲逛。就在那里，在一个发霉的“交换商店”，他买了这本小册子，《论灵魂的外放》。当这个年轻人到达埃德蒙的好莱坞公寓时，他携带着这本小册子。</p>
<p>路德维希和埃德蒙都对神秘学非常感兴趣。由于跟斯科特是老相识，他们曾涉猎过巫术和妖魔学，而斯科特拥有美国最好的神秘学藏书室之一。</p>
<p>斯科特是个怪人。身材苗条，目光敏锐，沉默寡言，他大部分时间都呆在巴尔的摩一栋古老的褐砂石住宅里。他对深奥事物的知识简直是惊人的，他读过《西哈亚仪式》（the Chhaya Ritual），在他写给路德维希和埃德蒙的信中，他暗示了那份半传奇的手抄本中含蓄的暗示及警告背后的真正含义。在他的大藏书室里，有锡尼斯特里（Sinistrari），赞克里乌斯（Zancherius）和声名狼藉的古格诺特·德·穆索（Gougenot des Mousseau）。据传，在他藏书室的保险柜里，有一本巨大的剪贴簿，里面全是从诸如《卡纳克之书》（the Book of Karnak），怪异的《六十石》（the Sixtystone）和据说地球上仅存两本的，亵渎的《旧钥》（the Elder Key）等各种离奇资料中的摘抄。</p>
<p>因此，这两个学生急于掀开面纱，看看斯科特如此谨慎地暗示的那些令人惊骇的秘密，也就不足为奇了。埃德蒙在日记中承认，他自己的好奇心是这场悲剧的直接原因。</p>
<p>然而，是路德维希买了这本小册子，并和埃德蒙一起在后者的公寓里仔细研究。埃德蒙把小册子描述得很清楚，奇怪的是，没有一个爱书人能认出它来。据日记所说，它很小，大约四乘五英寸，用粗糙的牛皮纸包裹，年代久远，已经发黄碎裂了。印刷——18世纪带有长S的字体——做得很粗糙，既没有日期行，也没有出版者的说明。一共有八页，其中七页都是埃德蒙老生常谈的神秘主义诡辩，最后一页上写的就是我们今天所说的“星体投射”（projecting one’s astral）的具体说明。</p>
<p>这两个学生对整个过程都很熟悉。他们的研究告诉他们，灵魂——或者用现代神秘的语言来说，“星光体”——应该是一种轻飘的替身或幽灵，能够投射到远处。但具体的方位——发现这些是不寻常的。它们似乎也不难理解。埃德蒙故意对这些准备工作含糊其词，但有人猜测，这两名学生在获得所需成分之前，拜访了几位化学家。他们在哪里弄到后来在悲剧现场发现的印度大麻是一个谜，但当然，这不是一个不可能的解决方案。</p>
<p>在八月十五日，路德维希显然在埃德蒙不知情的情况下，通过航空邮件给斯科特写信，描述了小册子及其内容，并征求他的意见。</p>
<p>在八月十八日晚，在肯尼斯·斯科特收到路德维希的信大约半小时后，两位年轻的神秘学者开始了他们灾难性的实验。</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>后来，埃德蒙责怪自己。在日记中，他提到了路德维希的不安，似乎后者察觉到了某种潜在的危险。路德维希建议将试验推迟几天，但埃蒙嘲笑他的恐惧。最后，两人把所需的材料放进火盆，并点燃混合物。</p>
<p>还有其他的准备工作，但埃德蒙十分含糊。他偷偷提到了一两次“七盏灯”以及“外颜色”，但这些术语不能构成任何东西。两人决定尝试将他们的星光体投射穿过个大陆，他们会尝试与肯尼斯·斯科特沟通。可以从中察觉年轻人的一丝虚荣心。</p>
<p>印度大麻在火盆中形成混合物的一种成分，这是通过分析确定的。正是这种印度毒品的存在，使许多人相信，埃德蒙日记中后来的记录，是由没有比鸦片或大麻梦中的幻想更切实的东西演变而来的。他们被引导着沿着奇怪的通道走，只因为当时学生们一心想着这些事情。埃德蒙梦见他看到了斯科特在巴尔的摩的房子。但是必须记住，他一直在盯着摆在面前桌子上的那所房子的一张照片，他有意识地想要去那儿。没有什么比这更合乎逻辑的了，埃德蒙只是做了他想做的梦。</p>
<p>但路德维希也有同样的幻象，至少他后来是这么说的——除非埃德蒙在文中撒了谎。佩里·L·刘易斯（Perry L. Lewis）教授，一位公认的梦景专家的观点是，爱德蒙在他做大麻梦的时候，大声地谈论了他的幻想，没有意识到这样做的意图，也没有后来的记忆——路德维希,同样在一个催眠性迷睡中，仅仅看到埃德蒙的话在脑海中显现。</p>
<p>抽大麻的人可能会会看到一间小小的门厅卧室变成了一个巨大的拱顶房间，同样地，埃德蒙说，他坐的那个房间似乎变大了。然而，奇怪的是，变大是一种奇怪的不正常的类型，房间的几何形状逐渐变得完全不对了。埃德蒙只强调这一点，并不想加以解释。就在变化变得明显的时候，他没有提到，但是很快他发现自己已经走到了一间房间的中间，虽然这屋子是他自己的，但它已发生了变化，直至以某一点为中心。</p>
<p>这里的记录几乎不连贯。埃德蒙显然觉得很难把他在幻象中所看见的描述出来。他奇怪地强调说，房间里所有的线条和曲线似乎都指向一个特定的地方，那就是正闷烧着药物与化学品的混合物的火盆。</p>
<p>一阵持续不断的铃声隐隐穿进他的耳中，但这声音越来越小，最后完全消失了。当时，埃德蒙认为这种声音是药物的作用。直到后来，他才知道斯科特正疯狂地试图通过长途电话与他取得联系。刺耳的铃声越来越微弱，渐渐消失在寂静中。</p>
<p>埃德蒙是一种实验性思维的人，他试着将目光转移到他记忆中的特定物体上，一个花瓶，一盏灯，一张桌子。但是房间里似乎有一种无以名状的粘稠的流动性，他发现他的目光不可避免地沿着弯曲的线条和曲线移动，直到他重新注视着火盆。就在这时，他意识到在那个地方发生了不寻常的事情。</p>
<p>混合物不再闷燃。相反，一种奇怪的晶体正在火盆里形成。埃德蒙觉得不可能形容这个物体，他只能说，这似乎是房间里弯曲线条的延续，把它们带到了中心点以外。显然，他没有意识到这样一个概念的疯狂，他继续说，当他看到晶体时，他的眼睛开始疼痛，但他不能转移他的目光。</p>
<p>晶体吸引着他。他感到一种突然且痛苦的吸力，空中传来一阵尖锐的敲击声，突然，他以越来越快的速度向火盆里的那个东西漂去。把他吸进去了——这是埃德蒙的一句无法解释的话。他感到一阵难以置信的寒冷，然后一个新的幻象出现在他面前。</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>不稳定的灰雾。埃德蒙强调了这种奇怪的流动感，他说这种感觉存在于他的内心。他感觉，他说，奇怪，像一团烟雾，摇摆不定，漫无目的地飘荡。但当他往下看时，他看到自己的身体，衣服都穿得好好的，显然相当实质化。</p>
<p>现在，一种可怕不安的感觉开始压迫他的精神。雾变浓了，旋转起来。鸦片吸食者所熟悉的噩梦，无缘无故的恐惧把他牢牢攫住。他感到有什么东西在逼近，一种极其可怕且惊人的强大威胁。然后，非常突然，雾消失了。</p>
<p>在他的下面，他看到了他起初以为是大海的东西。他毫无支撑地悬在空中，一股汹涌的灰色波光粼粼，从一个地平线爬到另一个地平线。起伏的铅灰色表面上点缀着无数圆形的黑点。他不由自主地感到自己被垂直地往下拉。当他接近那神秘的灰色时，他看得更清楚了。</p>
<p>他无法确定它的性质。它似乎只是一片原生质的、毫无特色的灰色黏液的海洋。但是这些黑斑变成了可以辨认的头颅。</p>
<p>“埃德蒙被拉向下面的一大群。”</p>
<p>埃德蒙的脑海里闪过一闪他曾经读过的一段故事，这是十二世纪阿尔贝里科（Alberico）修道士写的，声称是他堕入地狱的记录。和但丁一样，阿尔贝里科也经历过被诅咒者的折磨，亵渎者(他用生硬，卖弄学问的拉丁文写道)他们的脖子都被浸在熔化的金属湖里。现在埃德蒙想起了阿尔贝里科的描述。这时他才发现，那些头颅并不是部分浸在灰色黏液里的人的头颅。相反，它们与灰色同质。它们是长在它上面的！</p>
<p>埃德蒙的恐惧离开了他。他以一种奇特而超然的好奇心扫视着下面那奇异的表面。灰色的海面上有无数的人头在颠簸摆动，但绝大多数都不是人的。其中一些带有类人的痕迹，但其他的几乎认不出是活物。</p>
<p>因为头是活的。它们的眼睛带着可怕的痛苦地瞪着；他们的嘴唇在无声的叹息中扭动；眼泪顺着许多人凹陷的脸颊流下来。甚至是可怕的非人头颅——类禽的，爬行动物的，有生命的石头以及金属和植物组成的怪物的——显示出不断折磨它们的痕迹。埃德蒙被拉向下面的一大群。</p>
<p>黑暗再次笼罩着他。这是短暂的，但当他从瞬间的无意识中苏醒过来时，他感到(他说)奇怪地发生了变化。在那宿命的黑暗时期，他发生了一些事。似乎有一种朦胧的云雾笼罩着他的心灵，使他从一种薄雾中模糊地看待周围的事物。在这个新的幻象中，他仿佛置身于一个寂静月光下的城市上空，并迅速地朝下移动。</p>
<p>一轮满月，借着月光，他认出了他正往下靠近的那所古老的褐砂石住宅。肯尼迪·斯科特的家，他通过照片熟悉了这里。一种隐约的胜利震颤激动了他，实验成功了。</p>
<p>那幢房子隐约出现在他面前。他在一扇开着的，没有灯光的窗户外面徘徊。往里看，他认出了坐在桌旁的肯尼斯·斯科特的瘦长身形。神秘学者紧闭双唇，愁眉苦脸，脸色阴沉。那人面前打开着一本发黄羊皮纸书页的大书，他正仔细地读着。偶尔，他忧虑的目光会转向身旁桌上的电话。埃德蒙想叫一声斯科特，后者抬头望向窗外。</p>
<p>斯科特的脸立刻因震惊而转变。这人似乎吓得精神失常了。他从桌上跳起来，掀翻了他的椅子，同时，埃德蒙感到一种迫使他向前走的冲动。</p>
<p>在这之后发生的事混乱且模糊。到目前为止，埃德蒙的笔记支离破碎，我们只能推断出，埃德蒙当时就在房间里，以一种费解并反常的方式追赶着发狂的斯科特。他滔滔不绝地说着——而斯科特却被捉住并吞没了——说到这里，埃德蒙的笔记戛然而止，仿佛他已被这段经历的回忆压倒了。</p>
<p>仁慈的黑暗吞没了埃德蒙，但在他的梦消失不见之前，还闪过一个幻象。他似乎又来到了斯科特的窗外，又迅速消失夜色中，透过敞开的方形黄色光辉，可以看到斯科特桌子的一部分，以及躺在桌子另一边地毯上，他自己那具揉成一团的尸体。至少埃德蒙认为那是斯科特的尸体，因为要么这个人在躺着的时候把头弯成一个不可能的角度，压在他的躯干下面，于视线之外，要么他是无头的。</p>
<p>梦就此结束。埃德蒙醒来，发现屋子漆黑一片，路德维希睡意朦胧地在一旁走到。两个学生都心烦意乱，过度紧张。他们激动地争论了一会儿，偶尔还会爆发出半歇斯底里。路德维希透露说，他的幻象与埃德蒙的完全一样。遗憾的是，他们两人都没有费心去分析形势并寻求合乎逻辑的解释。当然，两人都是神秘主义者，而且完全容易轻信。</p>
<p>电话响了。一位不耐烦的接线员问埃德蒙德是否会接到来自巴尔的摩的电话。她说，她给公寓打电话已经有一段时间了，但没有得到回音。埃蒙突然打断了她，要求接通线路。但这是不可能的。巴尔的摩交换所的接线员报告说，她的人没有回应她。在徒劳地交换了几次问题后，埃德蒙挂断了电话。后来路德维希承认给斯科特写过信，他为自己的沉默而哀叹，正是这种沉默使他没有告诉这个巴尔的摩神秘学家实验的目的——星体被指向的目的。</p>
<p>在火盆里发现的物体也没有平息他们的恐惧。显然，至少有一部分幻象是建立在真理之上。那些未知的化学物质已经结晶成一种东西，看起来是所有的位面和角度。它是由一些类似磨砂玻璃的脆性物质构成的，大致呈金字塔形，从顶端到底部大约有六英寸。路德维希想马上把它打碎，但埃德蒙阻止了他。</p>
<p>斯科特发来的电报结束了他们的争论。上面写着：</p>
<p>不要企图做你们提到的小册子的试验 非常危险会害死我 我今天通过航空邮件给你们写详细情况 建议你们烧了小册子</p>
<p>肯尼迪·斯科特</p>
<p>后来又发生了两次通信，导致保罗·埃德蒙暂时住进了好莱坞的一家医院。第一封信出现在八月二十日日《洛杉矶时报》的晨报上。它简要地说，住在马里兰州巴尔的摩的著名作家兼神秘学者肯尼斯·斯科特被神秘地谋杀。没有线索表明行凶者的身份，尸体直到十九日下午才被发现。受害者的头从尸体被砍下来，而且莫名其妙地不见了，这一事实最初难以鉴定身份，但斯科特的医生证实了逻辑上的假设。弄脏地毯的大量灰色黏液给这个案子增加了另一层神秘色彩。验尸官宣布，斯科特的脑袋被一把锋利的刀从尸体上干净利落地割了下来。警方声明，不久将进行逮捕。</p>
<p>毋庸赘言，逮捕从没发生过。小报抓住了这一小块有趣的东西大肆报道，一位有胆略的记者发现了事实，在斯科特的死亡被确定之前不久，他从巴尔的摩中央邮政局寄出了一封航空邮件。正是这个消息，直接导致了埃德蒙的精神崩溃，使他退进医院去了。</p>
<p>这封信是在埃德蒙的公寓里找到的，但它并不能说明这件事。斯科特是一个有宗教幻觉的人，他的信与他的虚构作品有着近乎可疑的相似之处。</p>
<p>“你们俩都知道，”(跳过那封长信的一部分)“在古老的传说和民间传说背后，常常能找到多少真相。库克罗普斯不再是个神话，任何一个熟悉怪胎的医生都可以告诉你。你知道我关于灵药的理论是如何被重水的发现所证实的。嗯，海德拉的神话就是基于这样一个事实。”</p>
<p>“关于多头怪兽的故事数不胜数，所有这些故事都是从一个真实存在的实体中衍生出来的，而这个实体的真实存在多年以来却很少有人知道。这个造物不是来自地球，而是来自外界（Outside）的深渊。牠勉强算是吸血鬼的本质，不是靠受害者的血活着，而是靠他们的头颅——他们的脑髓。这听起来可能很奇怪，但是现在你们知道有一些存在在外界，牠们的需要与血肉与我们不同。历经万古，这个实体在超越我们维度的深渊中掠夺着，发出牠的呼唤，在牠能及之处夺去牺牲者的性命。因为这个实体，通过吸收这个世界和其他星球上有智慧的生物的头颅并脑髓，其力量与生气大大增强。”</p>
<p>“你们俩都知道，历代以来，总有些人愿意崇拜旧日支配者（the Great Ones）——甚至在民间传说中像恶魔一样来到我们这里的邪恶外星人——每一个神和每一个实体都有它的崇拜者，从黑色的法罗尔（Pharol）到最小的能力超过人类的外星人。这些教派以一种很奇怪的方式交织在一起，因此我们发现一种被遗忘的崇拜的痕迹，在很久以后突然出现。举个例子，当罗马人在意大利黑森林里崇拜玛格那玛特(Magna Mater)时，你认为他们为什么要把这种神秘的崇拜融入仪式中呢，‘戈贡，魔摩，千面之月’？这其中的含义很清楚。”</p>
<p>“我已经讲得相当详细了，但你们必须得准备好听我解释一下罗伯特在圣佩德罗找到的那个小册子的来历。我知道这本小册子，它是一七八三年在塞勒姆印刷的，但我原以为现在已经没有副本了。那本小册子是一个陷阱，一个最可恶的陷阱，是海德拉的崇拜者们为了引诱受害者们进入他们神明的胃里而设的！”</p>
<p>“它声称仅仅是一个关于自我星光体的无辜实验。然而，真正的目的是打开一扇门，并为海德拉准备一份祭品。当这些小册子第一次通过秘密地下渠道分发时，在新英格兰出现了死亡的流行。数十名无头男女被发现，没有任何人类谋杀者的痕迹。然而，真正的杀手是那些按照小册子上的指示进行实验的人，他们不知不觉地让海德拉使用他们的生命力在这个星球上物质化。”</p>
<p>“坦率地说，发生的事情是这样的：实验对象，按照指示吸入药物的烟雾，撕开了我们与外界之间的帷幕。他把注意力集中在他希望他的星光体造访之人的身上，而那个人是注定要死。实验者被拉到外界，进入另一个空间维度，并通过某种心理和化学过程暂时与海德拉成为一体。这意味着：海德拉，利用实验者的星光体作为寄主，来到地球并夺取牠的猎物——也就是实验对象一直关注的那个人。除了可能出现严重的精神冲击外，对实验者本人来说并没有真正的危险。但是另一个——受害者——被海德拉夺去了。他注定要遭受永恒的痛苦，除非在某些不寻常的情况下，他能与现世的精神保持心理联系。不过我不必说这些。”</p>
<p>“我非常担心。我已经给埃德蒙的公寓打了一个长途电话，毫无疑问，在这封信到达之前，你们今晚就会收到我的信了。如果你们在我能和你们联系之前鲁莽地进行这个实验，我将处于严重的危险之中，因为你们可以尝试把你们的星光体投射到巴尔的摩，投射到我的身上。等我把这封信寄出去，在等我的电话接通的时候，我会尽我最大的努力去寻找一个保护配方，尽管我认为不存在这个配方。”</p>
<p>“肯尼斯·斯科特。”</p>
<p>正是这封信把埃德蒙送到医院去住了几天，使他从紧张的状态中恢复过来。路德维希显然有更强大的实力。在埃德蒙的要求下，他呆在后者的公寓里，沉溺于自己的一些实验。</p>
<p>在接下来的几天里，埃德蒙的公寓里究竟发生了什么事，我们永远也不会完全知道。路德维希每天都到医院里去拜访他的房主，把他的实验情况告诉他，埃德蒙把他所能记得的记录在几张纸片上，后来把它们夹在他的日记里。人们倾向于相信，火盆里反常的药物混合物继续对这两个学生的思想产生影响，因为埃德蒙记录的路德维希的实验，显然像是最初大麻梦的延续。路德维希不出所料地把小册子烧掉了。在埃德蒙被送进医院的那个晚上，另一个年轻人说，他听到斯科特对他说话。</p>
<p>埃德蒙没有嘲弄他，因为他太容易轻信别人了。当路德维希宣布神秘学者还活着，尽管存在于另一个维度空间时，他全神贯注地听着。海德拉已经俘获了斯科特，但这位神秘学者有能力与路德维希交流。我们必须时刻记住，这两个年轻人在经历了精神上的搅动之后，都不太正常了。</p>
<p>所以路德维希每天都在他的故事里添加越来越多的内容，而埃德蒙听着。他们窃窃私语地说着话，埃德蒙蒙一直小心翼翼地看管他的笔记，以免落入心存怀疑的人手中。路德维希说，问题的关键在于火盆里形成的那种奇怪的晶体。正是这使通向外界的道路畅通无阻。如果人愿意，就可以穿过它，尽管事实上它还没人的脑袋那么大，因为这块水晶造成了一种“空间弯曲”——这个词埃德蒙提到过好几次，但根本没做解释。然而，海德拉无法返回地球，除非原始环境被复制。</p>
<p>路德维希说，他听见斯科特的声音从晶体疯狂的平面和角度中发出微弱的呢喃，神秘学者处于可怕的痛苦之中，坚持要路德维希救他。这并不难，只要学生完全按照指示去做。虽然有危险，但他必须有勇气，努力消除他所造成的伤害。只有这样，斯科特才能从无尽的痛苦中解脱出来，回到地球。</p>
<p>所以，路德维希告诉埃德蒙，他穿过水晶——又说了这句含糊离奇的话！——拿着斯科特说他需要的那些东西。其中最主要的是一把锋利的，骨柄的切肉刀。还有其他一些物品，其中有一些很难得到，路德维希并没有具体说明，即使他做了说明，埃德蒙也没有在他的笔记中提到。</p>
<p>根据路德维希的叙述，他穿过了水晶，并找到了斯科特。但并非一开始就找到。在斯科特声音的指引下，在摸索前行的夜晚里，历经古怪而可怕的，梦魇般的幻象。要经过好些道门，穿过好些个怪异的维度。路德维希就这样在脉动的可怕深渊中穿行；他穿过一个充满奇异紫罗兰光的地方，身后传来怪精叮叮当当的，邪恶的颤笑；他穿过一座荒凉的巨石城，战栗地认出那是传说中的狄斯。最终他找到了斯科特。</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>他做了必要的事。当他第二天来到医院的时候，埃德蒙被他朋友毫无血色的苍白，并他眼里闪烁着的疯狂微弱的光芒吓了一跳。瞳孔不自然地放大了。那天路德维希杂乱断续地低声说话，埃德蒙觉得很难听懂。笔记受损了。唯一清楚的是，路德维希宣称他已将斯科特从海德拉的魔掌中解救出来，年轻人一遍又一遍地不停嘟囔着他那把切肉刀的刀刃已被抹上了的可怕灰色黏液。他说他的任务还没有结束。</p>
<p>毫无疑问，罗伯特·路德维希的思想被药物毒化了，他讲述他如何把斯科特，或者至少是斯科特活着的那一部分，留在一个对人类生活并不有害，也不完全受自然规律和过程支配的空间位面上。斯科特想要回到地球。他现在可以回来了，路德维希告诉埃德蒙，但维持斯科特生命的奇特生气会在地球上立即消散。只有在某些位面和维度里，斯科特才有可能存在，而维持他生命的异界力量现在也渐渐消失了，因为他不再汲取海德拉的营养了。路德维希说，迅速采取行动是必要的。</p>
<p>在外界有一个地方，斯科特可以实现他的愿望。在那个地方，思想模糊地与能量和物质联系在一起，因为一种疯狂而尖利的笛声(路德维希说)不断地从闪烁着颜色的帷幕中过滤出来。那里非常靠近中心，混沌的中心，阿撒托斯，万物之主的居所。所有的存在皆由阿撒托斯的思想所创造，只有在终极混沌的核心，斯科特才能找到以人类形式再次生活在地球上的方法。在埃德蒙的笔记中有一处被抹去了，我们只能辨认出其中的片段：“……思想化作现实。”</p>
<p>脸色苍白，双颊深陷的路德维希说，他必须完成他的任务。他必须把斯科特带到中心，尽管他承认有一种可怕的恐惧使其犹豫不决。路上有着危险，也有容易被困住的陷阱。最糟糕的是，遮掩阿撒托斯的帷幕很薄，即使是朝万物之主最轻微的一瞥，对旁观者来说都意味着彻底全然的毁灭。斯科特说过这一点，路德维希说道，他还提到了可怕的诱惑，那会把年轻学生的眼睛拖到致命的地方，除非他强烈地反抗它。</p>
<p>罗伯特·路德维格紧张地咬着嘴唇离开了医院，我们猜想他在去埃德蒙公寓的路上遭遇了谋杀。因为埃德蒙再也没有于世间见到他的朋友了。</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>警方仍在寻找肯尼斯·斯科特失踪的头颅。这是埃德蒙在报纸上看到的。第二天，他焦急地等着路德维希的出现。几个小时过去了，还是杳无音讯。他给他的公寓打电话，没有回应。最后，他焦虑不安得几乎要病倒了。他和医生谈了十分钟，又和院长谈了十分钟。最后，他终于如愿以偿，不顾医院官员的反对，承出租车回自己的公寓去了。</p>
<p>路德维希失踪了。他消失得无影无踪。埃德蒙考虑叫警察过来，但很快就打消了这个念头。他在房间里紧张地踱来踱去，很少把目光从仍然放在火盆里的晶体上移开。</p>
<p>他的日记对那天晚上发生的事几乎没有提供任何线索。人们可以猜想到，他又准备了一剂致幻毒品，或者是埃德蒙几天前吸入的那股烟雾的毒性作用，终于使他的脑子崩溃了，他已不能分清真伪了。第二天早上写的日记唐突地开始。</p>
<p>“我听到他了。正如鲍勃所说，他通过晶体说话。他绝望了，告诉我鲍勃失败了。他没有把斯科特送到中心，或是S.可能再次出现在地球上，并救出鲍勃。某种东西——我不确定是什么——抓住了鲍勃，上帝保佑他。愿上帝帮助我们所有人……斯科特说我必须从鲍勃停下的地方开始，把工作完成。”</p>
<p>一个灵魂赤裸裸地躺在那记录的最后几页里，这是一幅令人不快的景象。不知怎么的，日记中描述的最惊人的怪异恐怖似乎没有上次发生在好莱坞公寓楼上的冲突可怕，当一个男人与他的恐惧搏斗，并意识到自己的软弱。那本小册子被毁了也许还好，因为其中所描述的那种破坏大脑的毒品，一定是来自于某个和埃德蒙所描绘的地狱一样可怕的地方。日记的最后几页展示了一个正在崩溃的心灵。</p>
<p>“我通过了。鲍勃让事情变得更容易了；正如斯科特所言，我可以从他结束的地方开始。我穿过冰冷火焰（the Cold Flame）和旋转涡流（Whirling Vortices）往上走，直到我到达斯科特所在的地方。确切地说，是他曾在哪里，因为在不得不回去之前，我把他抱起来，带着他穿过几个位面。鲍勃没有提到需要不断抵抗的吸力的问题。但直到我进入相当远的距离，这种感觉才会变得很强烈。”</p>
<p>下一段的日期是一天之后，内容几乎难以辨清。</p>
<p>“不能忍受它。不得不出去。在格里菲斯公园转了几个小时。然后我回到公寓，斯科特几乎马上就和我谈了起来。我害怕。我想他感觉到了，也害怕了，也生气了。”</p>
<p>“他说我们不能浪费任何时间。他的生气几乎消失了，他必须迅速到达中心并返回地球。我看见鲍勃了。只是瞥了一眼，如果斯科特没有告诉我，我也不会知道是他。不知怎么的，他是个彻头彻尾的疯子，而且很可怕。斯科特说，当他让自己被抓住的时候，他身体的原子已经适应了另一个维度。我得小心点。我们快到中心了。”</p>
<p>最后一段。</p>
<p>“再来一次就行了。天啊，我很害怕，非常害怕。我听到了笛声。它把我的脑子冻住了。斯科特朝着我大喊，催促着我，我想他是想淹没那声音——其他的声音，但他当然做不到。远处有一种非常微弱的紫罗兰色的光芒，还有闪烁的彩色光芒。斯科特告诉我，另一边，就是阿撒托斯。”</p>
<p>“我做不到。我不敢——跟着那些笛声，还有我看到的那些往下移动的影子。如果当我在看帷幕的时候朝那个方向看，就意味着——但斯科特对我非常生气。他说我是这一切的原因。我有一种几乎无法控制的冲动，想让它把我吸回去，然后冲破门——晶体。也许当我发现自己无法在下一次穿过时把目光从帷幕上移开，我就会那样做。我对斯科特说，如果他让我再回地球上喘口气，下次我就把工作做完。他同意了，但说要快点。他的生气流逝得很快。他说如果我不在十分钟内穿过门，他就会来追我。不过,他不会。让他一直在外界的生命在地球上没有任何用处，除了一两秒钟。”</p>
<p>“我的十分钟到了。斯科特正在门口互换。我不去！我无法面对它——也无法面对外界最后的恐怖，那些东西在帷幕后面移动，还有那尖呼着的可怕笛声——”</p>
<p>“我告诉你，我不会去的！不，斯科特——我不能面对它！你不能出来——像那样。你会死的——我告诉你我不会去的！你不能强迫我——我要先打碎门！……什么？不！不，你不能……你不能这么做！斯科特！不要，不要……天啊，他出来了——”</p>
<p>这是日记的最后一段，警察在埃德蒙的书桌上发现了它。一声可怕的尖叫，随后一股红色的液体从埃德蒙公寓门下缓缓渗出，致使两位无线电巡逻警察的到来。</p>
<p>保罗·埃德蒙的尸体在门附近被发现，他的头和肩膀躺在一个不断扩大的深红池子里。</p>
<p>旁边是一个翻倒的黄铜火盆，地毯上散落着一种白色的颗粒状物质。埃德蒙僵硬的手指仍然紧紧抓着那个物体，那个物体从此引起了许多议论。</p>
<p>从其性质来看，这件物品保存得非常完好。它的一部分涂上了一层特殊的灰色黏液，它的嘴被咬得紧紧的，它的牙齿撕裂了埃德蒙的喉咙，咬断了颈动脉。</p>
<p>没有必要再去寻找肯尼斯·斯科特失踪的脑袋了。</p>
<p>The End</p>
<p>————————</p>
<p>You will already be well aware of the in-joke origin of Bloch’s “The Shambler from the Stars" and its sequel, Lovecraft's “The Haunter of the Dark", and its sequel, Bloch’s “The Shadow from the Steeple. ” In the first HPL comes on stage as an erudite occultist who gets messily devoured by the avatar of Tsathoggua. In the second Bloch becomes Robert Blake and meets pretty much the same fate at the lobes of an avatar of Nyarlathotep. In the third, as Bloch himself revealed years later, Edmund Fiske is a mask for Bloch's friend and colleague Fritz Leiber. (Some have imagined Bloch himself in the role, misled by the red herring that Bloch sometimes used the pseudonym Tarleton Fiske). In “Hydra” we see the young Henry Kuttner joining the game. The character Robert Ludwig is surely Robert Bloch, the alter ego of Ludvig Prinn, while Paul Edmond must stand for Edmond Hamilton. Even though the character’s last name probably does derive from that source, a letter from Lovecraft to Bloch (December 3, 1936) reveals that the Paul Edmond character is supposed to be Kuttner himself, while Kenneth Scott is Lovecraft. All this leads us to speculate as to the origin of Kuttner’s own pseudonym: Is not Keith Hammond gematria for his early favorite and later friend Edmond Hamilton? I think so.</p>
<p>Note the reference to an occult volume called The Sixtystone. This is a tip of the hat to Arthur Machen and his great tale “The Novel of the Black Seal", where the eponymous “seal” is a peculiarly engraved polyhedron called Ixixar, or the Sixtystone. Kuttner had of course referred to Machen already in “The Salem Horror" and, implicitly, in "The Invaders", where the terminal devolution of Bill Mason recalls that of the expiring Helen Vaughan in Machen's “The Great God Pan. ”</p>
<p>Kuttner lifts the invocation “Gorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon" from Lovecraft, making it a summons to the goddess Cybele (whom HPL mentioned in “The Rats in the Walls”), though he had used the chant itself in “The Horror at Red Hook” and there made it the liturgy to Lilith. Originally it was neither, the words forming part of the ancient rites of Hecate instead.</p>
<p>Finally, the Mythos encyclopedist may pause and puzzle over the dropped name “Pharol.” Which ancient deity was this? You will find him featured prominently in some of the space adventures of Northwest Smith by Kuttner’s wife C. L. Moore, especially “Dust of the Gods” (see the collection Northwest Smith, Ace Books, 1981. Four additional Northwest Smith tales not included in that volume occur in Karl Wagner (ed.), Echoes of Valor II, TOR Books, 1989).</p>

<p>***</p>
<p>Two men died; possibly three. So much is known. The tabloids ran flaming headlines telling of the mysterious mutilation and death of Kenneth Scott, noted Baltimore author and occultists, and later, they capitalized similarly on the disappearance of Robert Ludwig, whose correspondence with Scott was well known in literary circles. The equally strange and even more ghastly death of Paul Edmond, while separated from the scene of the Scott horror by the width of a continent, was clearly connected with it. This was shown by the presence of a certain much-discussed object which was found clutched in Edmond’s rigid hands — and which the credulous claim caused his death. While this solution is improbable, it is nevertheless true that Paul Edmond bled to death because his carotid artery was severed, and it is also true that thre are features about the case difficult to explain in the light of present-day science.</p>
<p>The tabloids made a great deal of Edmond’s diary, and even conventional papers find it difficult to handle that unusual document in a fashion that would not lay them open to the charge of yellow journalism. The Hollywood Citizen-News solved the problem for its contemporaries by quoting the least fantastic portions of the diary, and hinting plainly that Edmond had been a fiction writer, and that the man’s notes had never been intended as a truthful summary of events. The privately printed pamphlet, On the Sending Out of the Soul, which played so important a part in the diary, seems to be of purely fictional origin. None of the local booksellers has heard of it, and Mr. Russell Hodgkins, Calofornia’s most noted bibliophile, declares that the title and the volume must have originated in the mind of the ill-fated Paul Edmond.</p>
<p>Yet, according to Edmond’s diary and certain other papers and letters discovered in his desk, it was this pamphlet which caused Ludwig and Edmond to undertake the disastrous experiment. Ludwig had decided to visit his California correspondent, making a leisurely voyage from New York by way of the Panama Canal. The Carnatic docked on August 15th, and Ludwig spent several hours wandering through San Pedro. It was there, in a musty “swap shop,” that he bought the pamphlet, On the Sending Out of the Soul. When the young man arrived at Edmond’s Hollywood apartment he had the booklet with him.</p>
<p>Both Ludwig and Edmond were deeply interested in the occult. They had dabbled in witchcraft and demonology, as a result of their acquaintance with Scott, who possessed one of the best occult libraries in America.</p>
<p>Scott was a strange man. Slender, sharp-eyed, and taciturn, he spent most of his time in an old brownstone house in Baltimore. His knowledge of esoteric matters was little short of phenomenal; he had read the Chhaya Ritual, and in his letters to Ludwig and Edmond had hinted at the real meanings behind the veiled hints and warnings in that half-legendary manuscript. In his great library were such names as Sinistrari, Zancherius, and the ill-famed Gougenot des Mousseau; and in his library safe he had, it was rumored, an immense scrapbook filled with excerpts copied from such fantastic sources as the Book of Karnak, the monstrous Sixtystone, and the blasphemous Elder Key, of which only two copies are reputed to exist on earth.</p>
<p>It was little wonder, therefore, that the two students were anxious to tear aside the veil and view the astounding mysteries of which Scott hinted so cautiously. In his diary Edmond confessed that his own curiosity was the direct cause of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Yet it was Ludwig who bought the booklet and pored over it with Edmond in the latter’s apartment. Certainly Edmond described the pamphlet plainly enough, and it is strange, therefore, that no bibliophile could identify it. According to the diary, it was quite small, about four by five inches, bound in coarse brown paper, and yellowed and crumbling with age. The printing — in Eighteenth Century type with the long s — was crudely done, and there was neither a date-line nor a publisher’s imprint. There were eight pages; seven of them filled with what Edmond called the usual banal sophisms of mysticism, and on the last page were the specific directions for what would nowadays be known as “projecting one’s astral.”</p>
<p>The general process was familiar to both students. Their researches had informed them that the soul — or in modern occult language, “astral body” — is supposed to be an ethereal double or ghost, capable of projection to a distance. But the specific directions — finding these was unusual. Nor did they seem difficult to follow. Edmond has purposely been vague about these preparations, but one gathers that the two students visited several chemists before obtaining the ingredients needed. Where they secured the cannabis indica later discovered on the scene of the tragedy is a mystery, but not, of course, one impossible of solution.</p>
<p>On August 15th, Ludwig, apparently without Edmond’s knowledge, wrote to Scott by air-mail, describing the pamphlet and its contents, and asking for advice.</p>
<p>On the night of August 18th, approximately half an hour after Kenneth Scott received Ludwig’s letter, the two young occultists undertook their disastrous experiment.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Later, Edmond blamed himself. In the diary he mentions Ludwig’s uneasiness, as though the latter sensed some hidden danger. Ludwig suggested postponing the trial for a few days, but Edmond laughed at his fears. It ended with the two placing the required ingredients in a brazier and kindling the mixture.</p>
<p>There were other preparations, too, but Edmond is quite vague. He makes one or two furtive references to “the seven lamps” and “the infra color,” but nothing can be made of these terms. The two had decided to attempt projection of their astral bodies across the continent; they would attempt communication with Kenneth Scott. One can detect a tinge of youthful vanity in this.</p>
<p>Cannabis indica formed one of the ingredients of the mixture in the brazier; that has been ascertained by analysis. It was the presence of this Indian drug which led so many to believe that the later entries in Edmond’s diary were evolved from nothing more tangible than the fantasies of an opium or hashish dream, directed along the curious channels they took merely because of the students’ preoccupation with thos things at the time. Edmond dreamed he saw Scott’s house in Baltimore. But it must be remembered that he had been staring at a photograph of that house which he had placed on the table before him; and he was consciously willing to go there. Nothing is more logical therefore, than that Edmond simply dreamed what he wanted to dream.</p>
<p>But Ludwig had the identical vision, or, at least, so he stated afterward — unless Edmond, in that entry, lied. It is the opinion of Professor Perry L. Lewis, a recognized expert on dream-phenomena, that Edmond, during his hashish vision, spoke of his illusions aloud, with no conscious intention of so doing, nor any later memory of it — and that Ludwig, as in a hypnotic trance, simply saw the phantasms Edmond’s words conjured up in his mind.</p>
<p>The marijuana smoker may see a tiny hall bedroom metamorphose itself into a huge vaulted chamber; similarly, Edmond stated that the room in which he sat seemed to enlarge. Oddly, however, the growth was of a strangely abnormal type; the geometry of the room gradually became all wrong. Edmond stresses this point without attempting to explain it. Just when the shifting became noticeable he does not mention, but presently he found himself in the midst of a chamber which, although recognizable his own, had changed until it centered at a certain point.</p>
<p>The notes are almost incoherent here. Edmond obviously found it difficult to describe what he saw in his vision. All the lines and curves of the room, he insists with odd emphasis, seemed to point at one specific spot, the brazier where the mixture of drugs and chemicals was smoldering.</p>
<p>Very faintly a persistent ringing came to his ears, but this dwindled and at last died away altogether. At the time Edmond thought the sound due to the effects of the drug. It was not until later that he learned of Scott’s frantic efforts to reach him by means of long-distance telephone. The shrill ringing grew fainter and faded into silence.</p>
<p>Edmond was of an experimental turn of mind. He tried to shift his gaze to specific objects he remembered, a vase, a lamp, a table. But the room seemed to possess an indescribable viscid fluidity, so that he found his stare inevitably slipping along warped lines and curves until he was again watching the brazier. And it was then that he became conscious of something unusual taking place at that spot.</p>
<p>The mixture no longer smoldered. Instead, a strange crystal formation was building itself up within the brazier. This object Edmond found impossible to describe; he could only say that it seemed a continuation of the warped lines of the room, carrying them beyond the point where they centered. Apparently unconscious of the insanity of such a concept, he goes on to say that his eyes began to ache as he watched the crystalline object, but he could not turn away his gaze.</p>
<p>The crystal drew him. He felt an abrupt and agonizing suction; there was a high-pitched thrumming in the air, and suddenly he was drifting with increasing velocity toward the thing in the brazier. It sucked him in — such is Edmond's inexplicable phrase; he felt a moment of incredible cold, and then a new vision rose up before him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Gray fog, and instability. Edmond stressed this curious feeling of flux, which he declared existed</p>
<p>within himself. He felt, he says oddly, like a cloud of smoke, wavering and drifting aimlessly. But when he glanced down he saw his own body, fully clothed and apparently quite substantial.</p>
<p>Now a dreadful feeling of uneasiness began to oppress his mind. The fog thickened and whirled; the nightmare, causeless fear familiar to the opium-taker clutched him in its grip. Something, he felt, was approaching, something utterly horrible and frightful in its potent menace. Then, quite suddenly, the fog was gone.</p>
<p>Far beneath him he saw what at first he took to be the sea. He was hanging unsupported in empty air, and a surging grayness shimmered and crawled from horizon to horizon. The fluctuating leaden surface was dotted and speckled with round dark blobs; these were innumerable. Without conscious volition he felt himself drawn down vertically, and as he approached the mysterious grayness he saw it more clearly.</p>
<p>He could not determine its nature. It seemed merely a sea of gray slime, protoplasmic and featureless. But the dark blobs became recognizable as heads.</p>
<p>“Down toward the ghastly</p>
<p>horde Edmond was drawn.”</p>
<p>Into Edmond’s mind flashed the memory of a narrative he had once read, written in the Twelfth Century by the monk Alberico, and purporting to be the record of a descent into Hell. Like Dante, Alberico had seen the torments of the damned; the blasphemers (he wrote in his stilted, pedantic Latin) has been immersed to their necks in a lake of molten metal. Edmond remembered Alberico’s description now. Then he saw that the heads were not those of beings partly submerged in the gray slime; instead, they were homogenous with the graynesss. They grew from it!</p>
<p>Edmond’s fear had left him. With oddly detached curiosity he scanned the fantastic surface below. There were human heads bobbing and nodding from the gray sea, uncountable thousands of them, but by far the greater number of the heads were not human. Some of these latter bore traces of the anthropoid, but others were scarcely recognizable as living objects.</p>
<p>For the heads lived. Their eyes stared with awful agony; their lips writhed in soundless laments; tears coursed down the sunken cheeks of many. Even the horribly inhuman heads — bird-like, reptilian, monstrous things of living stone and metal and vegetable matter — showed traces of the unceasing torment that gnawed at them. Down toward the ghastly horde Edmond was drawn.</p>
<p>Again blackness enveloped him. It was transitory, but as he emerged from momentary unconsciousness he felt (he says) curiously changed. Something had happened to him during that fateful period of darkness. There seemed to be a cloudy vagueness shadowing his mind, so that he viewed his surroundings darkly and through a kind of haze. In this new vision he seemed to be high in the air above a silent, moonlit city, and rapidly moving downward.</p>
<p>There was a full moon, and by its light he recognized the old brownstone house toward which he</p>
<p>was descending. It was Kenneth Scott’s home, made familiar to him by the photograph. A vague thrill of triumph warmed him; the experiment, then, had succeeded.</p>
<p>The house loomed up before him. He was hovering outside an open, unlighted window. Peering in, he recognized the slender form of Kenneth Scott seated at a desk. The occultist’s lips were tightly compressed, and a worried scowl darkened his face. A great book with yellowed parchment pages was open before the man, who was studying it carefully. Occasionally his worried eyes would turn to the telephone on the desk beside him. Edmond made an attempt to call to Scott, and the latter looked up, staring through the window.</p>
<p>Instantly a shocking change transformed Scott’s face. The man seemed to become quite insane with fear. He sprang up from the desk, overturning his chair, and simultaneously Edmond felt an impelling urge dragging him forward.</p>
<p>What happened after that is confused and hazy. Edmond’s notes are fragmentary at this point, and it is only possible to gather that Edmond was in the room and pursuing the frantic Scott in a fashion that was inexplicable and abnormal. He was flowing — and Scott was caught and engulfed — and here Edmond’s notes break off utterly, as though he had been overcome by remembrance of the episode.</p>
<p>Merciful blackness swallowed Edmond then, but there was one more flashing vision before the dream faded and was gone. Again he seemed to be outside Scott’s window, swiftly retreating into the night, and through the open square of yellow radiance was visible part of Scott’s desk and the crumpled body of the man himself lying on the carpet beyond it. At least Edmond assumed that it was Scott’s body, for either the man was lying with his head doubled at an impossible angle out of sight beneath his torso, or else he was headless.</p>
<p>That ended the dream. Edmond awoke to find the room in darkness, and Ludwig stirring sleepily near by. Both students were distracted and overwrought. They argued excitedly for some time, with occasional semi-hysterical outbursts, and Ludwig revealed that his vision had been identical with Edmond’s. It is a pity that neither of them took the trouble to analyze the situation and look for a logical explanation, but both, of course, were mystics, and thoroughly credulous.</p>
<p>The telephone rang. An impatient operator asked if Edmond would receive a call from Baltimore. She had, she said, been ringing the apartment for some time without getting a reply. Edmond cut her off abruptly and requested that the connection be put through. But this could not be done. The operator at Baltimore exchange reported that her party did not answer, and, after a futile exchange of questions, Edmond hung up. It was then Ludwig confessed to writing Scott, bemoaning the reticence that had made him refrain from telling the Baltimore occultist the purpose of the experiment — the destination to which the astrals were directed.</p>
<p>Nor were their fears calmed by the discovery of the object in the brazier. Apparently part of the vision at least had been founded on truth; the unknown chemicals had crystallized into a thing that appeared to be all planes and angles. It was formed of some brittle substance resembling frosted glass, was roughly pyramidal, and measured about six inches from apex to base. Ludwig wanted to smash it at once, but Edmond prevented him.</p>
<p>Their arguments were brought to an end by the arrival of a telegram from Scott. It read:</p>
<p>ATTEMPT NO EXPERIMENTS WITH PAMPHLET YOU MENTION STOP TREMENDOUSLY DANGEROUS AND MAY MEAN MY DEATH STOP AM WRITING YOU TODAY BY AIR MAIL FULL DETAILS STOP ADVISE YOU BURN PAMPHLET</p>
<p>KENNETH SCOTT</p>
<p>There were two more communications which resulted in Paul Edmond’s temporary stay at a Hollywood hospital. The first was an item which appeared in time for the morning edition of the Los Angeles Times of August 20th. It stated briefly that Kenneth Scott, well-known author and occultist, residing in Baltimore, Maryland, had been mysteriously murdered. There were no clues to indicate the identity of the assailant, and the body had not been discovered until the afternoon of the 19th. The fact that the victim’s head had been severed from his body and was inexplicably missing made identification at first doubtful, but Scott’s physician confirmed the logical supposition. A quantity of grayish slime smeared on the carpet added another element of mystery to the case. Scott’s head, the coroner declared, had been cleanly severed from his body by a sharp blade. Police stated that an arrest would be made shortly.</p>
<p>Needless to say, that arrest was never made. The tabloids seized the juicy morsel and made much of it, and an enterprising reporter unearthed the fact that Scott had sent an air-mail letter from the Baltimore Central post office shortly before the time at which his death had been fixed. It was this communication which was the direct cause of Edmond’s nervous collapse and his retirement to a hospital.</p>
<p>The letter was found in Edmond’s apartment, but it sheds little light on the case. Scott was a visionary, and his letter bears an almost suspicious resemblance to his fictional work.</p>
<p>“Both of you know,”(ran part of the long letter)“how much truth there is often to be found behind old legends and folk-lore. The Cyclops is no longer a myth, as any doctor familira with monstrous births can tell you. And you know how my theories regarding the Elixir Vit? have been confirmed by the discovery of heavy water. Well, the myth of the Hydra is based on such a truth.”</p>
<p>“There are innumerable tales of multi-headed monsters, all springing from the actual entity of whose real existence a very few have known through the ages. This creature did not originate on earth, but in the gulfs Outside. It was, after a fashion, a vampiric entity, living not on the blood of its victims but on their heads — their brains. This may sound strange to you, but you know by this time that there are beings Outside whose needs and flesh are not as ours. Through the eons this entity has ravened in the abyss beyond our dimension, sending out its call to claim victims where it could. For this entity, by absorbing the heads and brains of intelligent creatures both of this world and of other planets, emerges with its powers and vitality greatly augmented.”</p>
<p>“You both know that through the ages there have been certain people willing to worship the Great Ones — even the evil Aliens who have come down to us in folk-lore as demons. Every god and every entity has had its worshippers, from black Pharol to the least of the Aliens whose powers are more than human. And these cults intermingle in a very curious way, so that we find traces of a forgotten worship cropping up in far later times. When the Romans worshipped the Magna Mater in Italy’s dark forests, for instance, why do you suppose they incorporated into their ritual the mystic adoration, 'Gorgo Mormo, thousand-faced moon’? The implication is clear.”</p>
<p>“I have gone into considerable detail, but it has been necessary to prepare you for my explanation of the origin of that pamphlet Robert found in San Pedro. I knew of this booklet, which was printed in Salem in 1783, but I had thought that there were no longer any copies in existence. That pamphlet is a trap, and a most damnable one, created by the worshippers of the Hydra to lure victims into the maw of their god!”</p>
<p>“It purports to be merely an innocent experiment with the astral self. However, the real purpose is to open a gateway and prepare a sacrifice for the Hydra. When the booklets were first distributed, through secret underground channels, there was an epidemic of deaths in New England. Dozens of men and women were found headless, with no trace of any human murderer. Yet the real killers were the ones who performed the experiment according to the directions given in the booklet, and unknowingly let the Hydra use their vital forces to materialize on this planet.”</p>
<p>“Baldly speaking, what happens is this: the subject, following the instructions, inhales the fumes of the drug which tears apart the veil between our world and Outside. He concentrates upon the person whom he wishes his astral to visit, and that person is doomed. For the experimenter is drawn Outside, into another dimension of space, and through a certain psychic and chemical process is temporarily made one with the Hydra. What it amounts to is this: the Hydra, using the experimenter’s astral as a host, comes to earth and takes its prey — which is the person upon whom the subject has been concentrating. There is no real danger to the experimenter himself, save, perhaps, for a possible severe nervous shock. But the other — the victim — is taken by the Hydra for its own. He is doomed to eternal torment, except in certain unusual cases where he can maintain a psychic link with an earthly mind. But I need not speak of that.”</p>
<p>“I am greatly worried. I have put through a long-distance call to Edmond’s apartment, and no doubt you will hear from me tonight long before this letter can arrive. If you are rash enough to undertake the experiment before I can communicate with you, I shall be in grave danger, for you may attempt projection of your astral to Baltimore, to me. After I have posted this letter, and while I am waiting for my telephone call to be put through, I shall do my utmost to find a protective formula, although I do not think one exists.”</p>
<p>“Kenneth Scott.”</p>
<p>It was this letter which sent Edmond to the hospital for a few days to recover from his nervous</p>
<p>condition. Ludwig was apparently of stronger stuff; he stayed, at Edmond’s request, in the latter’s</p>
<p>apartment, and indulged in some experimenting of his own.</p>
<p>Just what happened in Edmond’s apartment during the next few days will never be fully known. Ludwig visited his host daily at the hospital, and told him of his experiments, and Edmond noted what he could remember on slips of paper which he subsequently inserted between pages of his diary. One is inclined to believe that the anomalous mixture of drugs in the brazier continued to exert its influence on the minds of the two students, for certainly Ludwig’s experiments, as recorded by Edmond, seem like a continuation of the original hashish dream.</p>
<p>Ludwig had burned the pamphlet, as might be expected. And then, on the night following Edmond’s removal to the hospital, the other youth maintained, he had heard Scott speaking to him.</p>
<p>Edmond did not scoff, for he was vastly credulous. He listened intently while Ludwig declared that the occultist was still alive, although existing in another dimension of space. The Hydra had captured Scott, but the occultist had the power to communicate with Ludwig. It is necessary to keep constantly in mind the fact that neither of these two youths was quite normal after the mental agitation he had undergone.</p>
<p>So Ludwig added more and more every day to his tale, and Edmond listened. They spoke furtively, in whispers, and Edmond kept careful watch over his notes so that they would not fall into skeptical hands. The whole crux of the matter, Ludwig said, was the strange crystalline object which had formed in the brazier. It was this which kept open the path to Outside. One could pass through it if one wished, despite the fact that it was not as large as a man’s head, because the crystal created a “warp in space” — a term Edmond mentions several times, but entirely neglects to explain. The Hydra, however, could not return to earth unless the original conditions were duplicated.</p>
<p>Ludwig said he had heard Scott’s voice whispering thinly from the crystalline thing of insane planes and angles, and the occultist was in horrible agony and insistent that Ludwig rescue him. It would not be difficult, provided the student followed instructions implicitly. There were dangers, but he must have courage, and strive to undo the harm he had done. Only thus could Scott be freed from endless agony and return to earth.</p>
<p>So, Ludwig told Edmond, he went through the crystal — again this vague and extraordinary phrase! — taking those things Scott had said he would need. Chief among these was a razor-keen, bone-handled carving knife. There were other objects, some of them difficult to obtain, which Ludwig did not specify, or which if he did, Edmond did not mention in his notes.</p>
<p>According to Ludwig’s narative, he went through the crystal, and he found Scott. But not at first. There were nights of fumbling progress through fantastic and terrible visions of nightmare, guided always by the insistent whisper of Scott’s voice. There were gates to be passed, and strange dimensions to traverse. And so Ludwig moved through awful abysses of pulsing, fearful darkness; he went through a place of curious violet light that sent tinkling, evil trills of goblin laughter after him; he went through a Cyclopean deserted city of ebon stone which he shudderingly recognized as fabled Dis. In the end he found Scott.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He did what was necessary. When he came to the hospital the next day Edmond was shocked by the bloodless pallor of his friend, and the little crawling lights of madness that shone in his eyes. The pupils were unnaturally dilated, and Ludwig spoke that day in disjointed whispers which Edmond found hard to follow. The notes suffered. It is only clear that Ludwig declared he had freed Scott from the grip of the Hydra, and that over and over again the youth kept muttering something about the terrible gray slime that had smeared the blade of his carving-knife. He said his task was not yet ended.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly it was the drug-poisoned mind of Robert Ludwig speakking when he told how he had left Scott, or at least the living part of him, in a plane of space which was not inimical to human life, and which was not subject to entirely natural laws and processes. Scott wanted to return to earth. He could return now, Ludwig told Edmond, but the strange vitality that maintained life in what was left of Scott would dissipate immediately on earth. Only in certain planes and dimensions was it possible for Scott to exist at all, and the alien force that kept him alive was gradually departing now that he was no longer drawing sustenance from the Hydra. Ludwig said that quick action was necessary.</p>
<p>There was a certain spot Outside where Scott could achieve his desire. In that place thought was obscurely linked to energy and matter, because of an insane shrill piping (Ludwig said) that eternally filtered from beyond a veil of flickering colors. It was very near the Center, the Center of Chaos, where dwells Azathoth, the Lord of All Things. All that exists was created by the thoughts of Azathoth, and only in the Center of Ultimate Chaos could Scott find means to live again on earth in human form. There is an erasure in Edmond’s notes at this point, and it is only possible to make out the fragment: “. . .of thought made real.”</p>
<p>White-faced, hollow-cheeked, Ludwig said that he must complete his task. He must take Scott to the Center, although he confessed to a horrible fear that made him hesitate. There were dangers in the way, and pitfalls where one might easily be trapped. Worst of all, the veil shielding Azathoth was thin, and even the slightest glimpse of the Lord of All Things would mean utter and complete destruction to the beholder. Scott had spoken of that, Ludwig said, and had also mentioned the dreadful lure that would drag the young student’s eyes to the fatal spot unless he fought strongly against it.</p>
<p>Biting his lips nervously, Robert Ludwig left the hospital, and we assume met with foul play on his way to Edmnd’s apartment. For Edmond never saw his friend again on earth.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The police were still seaching for the missing head of Kenneth Scott. Edmond gathered that from the newspapers. He waited impatiently the next day for Ludwig to appear, and after several hours had passed without result, he telephoned his apartment and got no response. Eventually, worried and almost sick with anxiety, he spent a turbulent ten minutes with his doctor and another with the superintendent. Finally he achieved his purpose and went by taxi to his apartment, having overruled the objection of hospital officials.</p>
<p>Ludwig was gone. He had vanished without a trace. Edmond considered summoning the police, but speedily dismissed the thought. He paced about the apartment nervously, seldom turning his gaze from the crystalline object that still rested in the brazier.</p>
<p>His diary gives little clue to what happened that night. One can conjecture that he prepared another dose of the narcotic drug, or that the toxic effects of the fumes Edmond had inhaled several days before had finally worked such disintegration within his brain that he could no longer distinguish between the false and the real. An entry in the diary dated the following morning begins abruptly, “I’ve heard him. Just as Bob said, he spoke through the crystal thing. He’s desperate, and tells me that Bob failed. He didn’t get Scott to the Center, or S. could have materialized again on earth and rescued Bob. Something — I’m not sure what — caught Bob, God help him. May God help all of us. . . . Scott says I must begin where Bob left off and finish the job.”</p>
<p>There is a soul laid bare on the last pages of that record, and it is not a pleasant sight. Somehow the most frightful of the unearthly horrors the diary describes seem not quite as dreadful as the last conflict that took place in that apartment above Hollywood, when a man wrestled with his fear and realized his weakness. It is probably just as well that the pamphlet was destroyed, for such a brain-wrecking drug as was described in it must surely have originated in some hell as terrible as any which Edmond portrays. The last pages of the diary show a mind crumbling into ruin.</p>
<p>“I went through. Bob has made it easier; I can begin where he left off, as Scott says. And I went up through the Cold Flame and the Whirling Vortices until I reached the place where Scott is. Where he was, rather, for I picked him up and carried him through several planes before I had to return. Bob didn’t mention the suction one has to keep fighting against. But it doesn’t get very strong until I’ve got quite a distance in.”</p>
<p>The next entry is dated a day later. It is scarcely legible.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t stand it. Had to get out. Walked around Griffith Park for hour. Then I came back to the apartment and almost immediately Scott talked to me. I’m afraid. I think he senses that, and is frightened too, and angry.”</p>
<p>“He says we can’t waste any more time. His vitality is almosy gone, and he’s got to reach the Center quick and get back to earth. I saw Bob. Just a glimpse, and I wouldn’t have known it was he if Scott hadn’t told me. He was all-awry, and horrible somehow. Scott said the atoms of his body had adapted themselves to another dimension when he let himself get caught. I’ve got to be careful. We’re nearly at the Center.”</p>
<p>The last entry.</p>
<p>“Once more will do it. God, I’m afraid, horribly afraid. I heard the piping. It turned my brain into ice. Scott was shouting at me, urging me on, and I think trying to drown that — other sound, but of course he couldn't do it. There was a very faint violet glow in the distance, and a flickering of colored lights. Beyond, Scott told me, was Azathoth.”</p>
<p>“I can’t do it. I don’t dare — not with that piping, and those Shapes I saw moving far down. If I look in that direction when I’m at the Veil it will mean — but Scott is insanely angry with me. He says I was the cause of it all. I had an almost uncontrollable impulse to let the suction draw me back, and then to smash the Gateway — the crystal thing. Maybe if I find myself unable to keep looking away from the Veil when next I go through I’ll do just that. I told Scott if he let me come back to earth for one more breathing-space I’d finish the job this next time. He agreed, but said to hurry. His vitality is going fast. He said if I didn’t come through the Gateway in ten minutes he’d come after me. He won’t, though. The life that keeps him going Outside wouldn’t be any use on earth, except for a second or two.”</p>
<p>“My ten minutes is up. Scott is calling from the Gateway. I’m not going! I can’t face it — not the last horror Outside, with those things moving behind the Veil and that awful piping screaming out—”</p>
<p>“I won’t go, I tell you! No, Scott — I can’t face it! You can’t come out — like that. You’d die — I tell you I won’t go! You can’t force me — I’ll smash the Gateway first!... what? No! No, you can’t... you can’t do it!... Scott! Don’t, don’t... God, he’s coming out—”</p>
<p>That was the last entry in the diary, which police found open on Edmond’s desk. A hideous screaming and subsequently a stream of red liquid seeping out sluggishly from beneath the door of Edmond’s apartment had resulted in the arrival of two radio patrol officers.</p>
<p>The body of Paul Edmond was found near the door, the head and shoulders lying in a widening crimson pool.</p>
<p>Near by was an overturned brass brazier, and a flaky white substance, granular in nature, was scattered over the carpet. Edmond’s stiff fingers still tightly gripped the object which has since been the cause of so much discussion.</p>
<p>This object was in an incredible state of preservation, in view of its nature. Part of it was coated with a peculiar grayish slime, and its jaws were clamped tightly, the teeth having horribly mangled Edmond’s throat and sevred the carotid artery.</p>
<p>There was no need to search further for the missing head of Kenneth Scott.</p>
<p>The End</p>
