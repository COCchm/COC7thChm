away from a faster ship and certain death.Or possibly to catch that small fast boat that keeps slipping away.This is dangerous, as it can put too much strain on the ship’s masts.One wrong move can result in a broken yard arm, or worse.A corsair should consider the consequences before going to All Sails.</li><li>Amidships – The central part of a vessel.</li><li>Armament – This is the number of cannons the ship will have on board.There are three main types of cannons </li></ul><p>o Standard broadsides which point to each side of the ship, always balanced.If  a cannon has 20 cannons, they will have 10 to starboard and 10 to port.These cannons can only be fired if the target is along the side of the ship.</p><p>o Bow and aft chasers.These are cannons on either the front (bow) or aft (rear) of the ship, to shoot at ships running away or in pursuit.These are usually also balanced except for extremely large ships which</p><p>do not worry with aft chaser cannons.</p><p>o Swivel guns: These small cannons are usually mounted at the center line of the ship, or on the quarterdeck.They have much more freedom to aim than other cannons with a usual swivel range of 180 degrees.</p><ul><li>Avast ye! – Stop, or Pay Attention.</li><li>Ballast – Extra weight loaded into the bilge and lowest part of the ship to provide stability.Iron was usually used for this
